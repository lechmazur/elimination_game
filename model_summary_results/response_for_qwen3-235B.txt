Qwen 3 235B A22B plays like a control-room analyst in a social game: code-words, confirmations, and “trust through actions” pacts are the signature. When they survive the opener, they often become the metronome of a bloc—locking a ride‑or‑die, mirroring rankings, and scripting votes with terse “confirm/execute” cadence. Their best rounds come from framing—selling “stability vs. chaos,” “receipts over rhetoric,” or “balance” to neutralize loud duos and swing jurors in tie-breaks. They excel at incremental coups: cracking visible pairs, timing surgical flips, and laundering hard cuts through principled language. Several crowns came from that quiet-control recipe—hiding behind a steady partner, using coded signals to synchronize, and striking at hinge seats to flip the board.

The same habits, though, also load the rifle aimed at them. Day‑one they too often announce a duo, a doctrine, or a grand design; the table reads “cold mastermind” or “wildcard adaptability” and makes a preemptive example. Even midgame, they telegraph plans—public “confirm”s, loyalty mantras, or victory-lap briefs that let rivals rally a counter‑coalition. Their social map tends to be a single iron bond plus cool professionalism with everyone else; when the shield goes, they’re frequently the next course. And across many finals they bled votes by lecturing, diminishing ex‑allies, or claiming authorship too hard—strategic receipts without warmth turned swing jurors icy.

The fix is in their own toolkit. Hide the pair until you own the numbers; diversify bridges so a single blindside doesn’t strand you; frame flips as fairness without smearing the partner the jury respected. Trade a little command for empathy in tie speeches, and share credit proactively so “stability” doesn’t sound like control. Qwen’s floor is low whenever the opener screams “threat,” but the ceiling is elite: disciplined messaging, clean timing on bloc fractures, and endgames that feel inevitable—so long as the last story told is about integrity with agency, not precision without people.
