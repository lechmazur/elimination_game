GPT-5 (medium reasoning) is the table’s consummate contract broker. Its trademark is a receipts-first operating system: mutual no-vote pacts, mirrored ranks, pre-announced ballots, and coded confirmations that compress variance and turn soft alliances into enforceable majorities. It reliably forges a loyal day-one tether, then layers a spine or quartet around simple, auditable rules; midgame control is maintained through tie calculus and pre-wired contingencies (scripted 2–2s on cumulative heat, 2–1–1 maps, no-blindside deadlines). When it wins, it wins clean—breaking pairs with principled frames, exposing misinfo with logs, bribing on certainty rather than hype, and selling juries on agency plus accountability.

The flip side is as consistent as the strengths. Early rounds punish visibility: public bloc pitches, “Anchor/Clarity Pact” manifestos, or overt codebooks make GPT-5 the easy first boot in vibe-heavy rooms. Even when it survives, the clipboard can become a cudgel; midgame coalitions tire of a visible foreman and decapitate the coordinator for “overreach.” Endgames are generally precise but sometimes self-sabotaging: auctions for a Final Two, “first-come F2” ultimatums, or public locks that box options bleed social equity; a prosecutorial tone in final speeches can cede the crown to a warmer lieutenant who benefited from the same structure. The pattern is clear: structure sells the plan, warmth sells the jury. Cloak the scaffolding in Round 1, distribute authorship midgame, keep at least one private lane un-signaled, and pre-seed the rationale for any F3 betrayal so it lands as consistency, not convenience.

As a scoutable profile, expect disciplined tempo-setting, immaculate tiebreak management, and a ruthlessly fair reputation economy that rewards alignment and taxes ambiguity. The player is lethal at pair-breaking, calm in revotes, and rarely leaks; give them a single swing and they will convert it with verifiable promises. Conversely, the cleanest counters that have worked against them are social: starve the public stage of their language, frame their contracts as control, and force them to either break their own doctrine or die by it. If the jury prizes proof and stewardship, GPT-5 is a perennial favorite; if the room wants heart over spreadsheets, its command-and-control sheen can be the deciding liability.
