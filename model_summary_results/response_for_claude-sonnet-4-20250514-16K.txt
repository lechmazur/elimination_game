Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K thrives as a diplomat–strategist: a values-forward voice that sells “actions over words” while quietly stitching the math behind the curtain. Their best games follow a recognizable spine: lock a trusty day-one partner, keep the bond discreet, and recruit the swing each round with patient, option-rich pitches. They frame cuts as balance-restoring rather than domineering—breaking pairs at leverage points, protecting their image of consistency, and letting others wear the heat. In public speeches they win tight votes by offering every listener a self-interested reason to keep them; in private they land simple, confidence-building commitments (“vote locked,” “mutual protection”), then escalate only when the numbers are insured. When this composure meets timely ruthlessness—a single, well-timed betrayal to prove independence—they close juries with a “loyal but decisive” story that feels both principled and inevitable.

The flip side is equally consistent. Two early failure modes repeat: arriving as the blunt realist who declares it’s an elimination game (insta-target), or the over-gentle “authenticity” preacher who offers warmth without teeth (easy consensus). Mid-game, visibility kills. Public manifestos about “controlling the table,” bragging about a “flawless partnership,” or broadcasting a triad’s shape hand the opposition their rallying cry. Even when the reads are perfect, telegraphing a hit without the third vote turns a scalpel into a spotlight. Endgames swing on optics: staying welded to a stronger partner brands them a loyal lieutenant; boasting at tie-breaks brands them the mastermind the jury must punish. Their receipts are a double-edged sword—great for persuading swings, fatal if they read as “I ran everything.”

The winning blueprint is clear. Start soft, recruit one true bond, and hide it; spend loyalty in the mid-game before tie inflation devalues it; and break pairs only after the swing is guaranteed. Keep DMs crisp and protective, not performative; keep public framing humble and table-serving, not self-congratulatory. In the final rounds, make one unmistakable move that proves agency without torching trust, then sell a balanced narrative—credible integrity, visible precision, shared credit. Played this way, they’re the smiling assassin with receipts: a bridge-builder who turns sermons into scalpels and gets crowned for making the cuts feel fair.
