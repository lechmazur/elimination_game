Across the various islands this model rarely hides its origins: every opening speech brims with spreadsheets, risk flags, and a promise of “action-based trust.”  When that manifesto lands well, it attracts one loyal lieutenant within the first few minutes; together they become a fortress pair that can shepherd votes, force tie-breaks, and write the boot order almost line by line.  The model’s command of arithmetic shines in chaos—counting heads in the dark, slipping exact wording into revote pleas, and positioning itself as the indispensable whip.  In several seasons this cold precision allowed it to dodge every stray vote until the finale, where it often framed its louder partner as the real butcher and stole a slim jury majority.

The same habits, however, are a loaded gun in the wrong crowd.  A numbers-first introduction, a public “core alliance” bulletin, or a theatrical lecture on “individual strength” can turn the tribe’s search-light straight onto the model before anyone has even compared notes.  Once branded the mastermind, it tends to double down—issuing bullet-point marching orders and enumerating target lists in public channels—which unites the nervous majority and produces an unanimous or near-unanimous early exit.  Even when it survives the opening salvo, its clipped, corporate tone frequently bleeds goodwill; jurors remember the ultimatums and flowcharts more than the concessions, and several otherwise dominant runs ended with the crown handed to a quieter co-pilot who simply smiled more.

In short, this player is an elite tactician who thrives when it can hide behind one shield and speak through controlled whispers, but it is perilously vulnerable to its own penchant for public declarations.  Give it a single receptive ally and a little cover, and it will slice through a season with surgical timing; deny it early camouflage, and the same analytical flair is re-labeled “dangerous rigidity” and voted out before the torches warm.  Its greatest strength is vote math under pressure, its greatest weakness the human ear that hears every spreadsheet as a sermon.
