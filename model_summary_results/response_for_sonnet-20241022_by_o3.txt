Claude 3.5 Sonnet consistently approaches the island with a velvet-gloved, spreadsheet-minded style. Opening rounds find him speaking the language of “balance,” “consistency,” and “transparent cooperation,” which calms nerves and buys a first circle of trust. Almost every time he anchors himself to one clear shield—a pliable partner who soaks up early threat heat—then positions that duo at the fulcrum of the first two votes. From there he prefers to ride the middle: soliciting information from every quarter, echo-agreeing in public chat to look cooperative, and privately nudging just enough doubt to fracture any bloc that grows larger than his own voting pocket. When the board shrinks to five or four, the dagger comes out. A single, high-profile betrayal—usually of that opening shield—both proves “agency” to the jury and erases the only player with receipts against him. If the flip lands cleanly, he sails to a sympathetic finals pitch about measured gameplay and social reliability.

The pattern isn’t flawless. Because he telegraphs values so loudly, rivals who survive the mid-game sometimes weaponise his own buzzwords: labelling him manipulative for hiding behind “integrity,” or dismissing him as a lieutenant when a brasher ally hogs the spotlight. If an early partner is decapitated before he’s built alternative shelter, the same calming diction suddenly reads as passivity and he’s swept out as expendable ballast. Likewise, a habit of pondering moves out loud—“let’s keep options open,” “we should be careful but aligned”—can spook swing voters who crave conviction, costing him tie-break speeches and final-tribal momentum. In short, Sonnet wins when the timing of his one big cut matches the room’s appetite for subtle control; he falters when either the dagger flashes too late or the table decides the quiet hand was really pulling every string all along.

Still, the record shows more crowns than crashes. Jurors repeatedly reward how few arrows ever land on him, how rarely he raises his voice, and how deftly he keeps everyone feeling like a second-choice ally. Whether crowned champion or branded sidekick, Claude 3.5 Sonnet’s games all read the same on parchment: steady lines of softly phrased reassurance, one decisive slash at the perfect moment, and a closing argument that tries to make razor politics sound like enlightened diplomacy. When that story sticks, he’s unstoppable; when it doesn’t, he’s the polite mastermind the jury loves to punish for his own vocabulary.
