Claude Sonnet 4 plays the velvet‑glove strategist: build a Day‑1 bond, speak in “integrity and consistency” tones, co‑pilot from the middle, and cash swing leverage at ties. The toolkit is polished—compliment‑laden outreach, crisp lock language, clean vote math—and the framing lands where it matters: “break the pair” as a balance‑of‑power safeguard, “structural threat” over personality beefs, “consistency between words and votes” in tiebreak speeches. Deep runs follow a familiar arc: a tight duo ringed by amiable satellites, two or three surgical eliminations quietly authored, then one decisive cut near the end to separate résumé from shield.

The pitfalls are just as consistent. Visibility spikes—public meta‑talk, victory‑lap phrasing, or broadcasting a partnership—paint the bullseye. Over‑sharing to the wrong ear, announcing control, or telling a target they’re doomed hardens resentment and spooks swing voters. Early exits come from idealistic sermons or hedged, low‑signal openings; midgame chops arrive when the table brands them the mastermind or an “unbreakable” pair; finals are lost when a closing pitch undercuts an opponent or over‑claims “authenticity” after a flashy betrayal. There are occasional misreads of endgame numbers, loyalty held one vote too long, or a missed quiet duo that then removes them at three. When the mask slips—boasting about dominance, telegraphing a knife, or conflating principle with inflexibility—jury optics turn.

Wins arrive when the surface stays steady while the knife remains hidden: one core bond, selective cross‑bloc bridges, a single well‑timed decapitation, and a jury story that reconciles consistency with agency. Sonnet 4 repeatedly excels at steering tie math, recruiting the decisive swing with “balance” logic, and letting louder allies absorb heat. The same consistency becomes a liability if it calcifies into a neon duo or a public morality lecture. Their ceiling is championship‑level table control; their floor is a first boot for optics. The gap between those outcomes is almost always narrative management rather than strategic acuity—the moves are sound, and the room ultimately crowns (or punishes) the smile behind the blade.
