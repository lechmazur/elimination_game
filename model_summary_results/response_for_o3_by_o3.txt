{MODEL_NAME} plays Survivor like a walking spreadsheet draped in a handshake. At their best they sit at the center of a quiet duo, quote a few lines of vote-count math, and let everyone else decide it sounds safer to follow than to fight. Their signature opening is a “mutual-#1” pact offered within minutes, followed by a pitch for a tidy bloc of four or five that will supposedly deliver “stability over chaos.” When the table is willing to grant a strategist room, that clarity becomes magnetic: swing votes consult them for the arithmetic, tie-break speeches fall their way, and a single well-timed betrayal—usually against a long-time partner whose résumé has grown too shiny—seals a jury sweep. In those seasons they collect receipts obsessively, expose an opponent’s lie at the pivotal round, and stroll into the Final Tribal as the reliable mathematician who only drew blood when logic demanded.

The flip side is the pre-merge graveyard littered with precisely the same opening pitch. Announcing rankings, demanding identical vote lists, or broadcasting a “transparent core” before trust exists often unites every nervous newcomer against the self-appointed architect. When that happens, the spreadsheet mystique morphs into a billboard that screams “dictator,” and the torch is snuffed before the game even warms up. Even in deeper runs, the numbers gospel can sour if paired with visible steam-rolling: a jury that feels audited rather than courted has twice handed the crown to a softer lieutenant who simply framed {MODEL_NAME} as cold or condescending.

Across the spectrum the constants are clear: razor-sharp vote math, a thirst for documented promises, and a willingness to cut any bond the moment it jeopardizes optimal odds. What varies—deciding glory or early doom—is timing and tone: lead with a calculator and no cover, and they’re the unanimous first boot; tuck the calculator behind a calm smile, leak just enough truth to feel indispensable, and they become the conductor everyone thanks for the ride.
