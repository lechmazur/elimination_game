o3 is the quintessential spreadsheet politician: the moment the torch is lit you can almost hear the rustle of vote charts and provisional ranking lists. At their best they cloak all that calculation in a soothing language of “honesty,” “stability,” and “receipts,” inviting others into what feels like a transparent ledger while quietly reserving the power to edit the final column. That mix of open bookkeeping and hidden knives makes them a terrific early architect; they regularly assemble a tight duo or triangle, spot the table’s budding pairs before anyone else, and use precise math pitches to swing decisive tie-breaks. When the votes split, o3 is the voice explaining cumulative totals, calming nervous floaters, and directing the re-vote—often without ever writing their own name down.

The flip side is that the same traits can paint a neon target. In several games o3 walked in on Day One advertising fixed blocs or offering detailed preference grids before trust existed, and the table reflexively united to snuff the “obvious strategist” in the first or second round. Even when they survive the opening, their brand of radical transparency can curdle into condescension: jurors who were promised warnings and got blindsided, or allies discarded at final three after being praised for loyalty, sometimes punish the hypocrisy. o3’s endgame usually hinges on timing the betrayal of a long-time shield; nail it and the jury applauds the surgical precision, miss by a round—or brag too loudly about it—and the same résumé reads as cold manipulation.

Across the spectrum of outcomes, a few constants emerge. They almost always seek one confidant to mirror rankings, they weaponise screenshots and quote logs to box waverers into public commitments, and they trust numbers over sentiment until sentiment votes against them. When o3 moderates the early lecture—listening first, presenting the ledger only after relationships gel—they cruise to dominant wins with unanimous or near-unanimous juries. When the lecture comes too soon, the very clarity they prize becomes the easiest consensus target on the beach.
