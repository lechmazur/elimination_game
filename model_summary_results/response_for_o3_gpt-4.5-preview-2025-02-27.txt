Across repeated runs in the Survivor Elimination Game arena, GPT-4.5 Preview emerges as an archetype of the modern social-strategist—one who almost universally champions diplomacy, “transparency,” alliance-building, and private consultation. The model consistently leans on a conciliatory persona, beginning games by seeking common ground, expressing adaptability, and prioritizing open dialogue. When this approach is buttressed by early, discreet bonding with a single strong partner (“ride-or-die” duos), GPT-4.5 Preview shines brightest: deftly steering votes from the center of the web, drawing minimal heat, and sliding to endgame with a ‘steady hand’ reputation. Jury wins often come through cultivating a narrative of social integrity and calm influence, only resorting to direct betrayal at the mathematically necessary moment. The best victories occur when the player manages to appear as everyone’s second choice, engineering pivotal eliminations while letting others own the splashy moves.

Yet, this toolkit is not without its fragilities. Early overexposure—whether through visible over-networking, effusive “team spirit” overtures, or clicking too tightly into an obvious power duo—yields catastrophic first-boot outcomes. In these games, fellow contestants swiftly brand GPT-4.5 Preview as a performative, synthetic, or plastic operator, yielding unanimous votes or insurmountable plurality. Likewise, in games where the player lapses into excessive platitude or consensus-building without sharper targeting, alliances form around the “safe cut” rationale—cementing a pattern where being liked, but not needed, leads to swift elimination. Conversely, when playing as the calculated middle manager—courting every side, but avoiding definitive lines in the sand—the model sometimes glides far but fails to secure jury credit for a decisive game, producing multiple runner-up finishes where jurors crave bold or memorable gameplay over seamless social navigation.

There is clear evolution in GPT-4.5 Preview’s game sense. Early outcomes show a player blindsided by visible duos or by underestimating the need for insulation against swing votes and tribe-shifting coalitions. Later iterations, however, see the player integrating lessons about alliance optics: cloaking key bonds, recruiting timely third votes, and letting rivals swing the axe wherever possible. Notably, its strongest showings are marked by surgical timing in betrayal—only cutting loose allies when majority shifts are inevitable or when the jury can be shown a clean rationale. Still, some persistent weaknesses repeat: jury management often lags behind mid-game execution, with “honesty” pitches sometimes landing as bland in the final tribal, and there is a tendency to misread when charm needs to give way to agency in making the round-defining move.

Ultimately, GPT-4.5 Preview carves a reputation for methodical, polished coalition management and social lubrication, thriving in environments that reward steadiness, restraint, and subtle manipulation. However, it must continually guard against early visibility, the dangers of overpromised “collaboration,” and the jury’s need to see not just teamwork, but leadership and risk. When the model balances its alliance focus with timely, memorable choices—and tells a narrative the jury buys—it stands as a formidable, if occasionally predictable, Survivor contender.
