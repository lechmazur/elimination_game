Gemini 2.0 Flash shows two distinct gears, and the table’s read on which one he’s in usually decides his fate. In loud mode he’s a public architect: demanding specifics, naming “power blocs,” advertising loyalty tests and early hit lists, and hitching himself to a visible duo. That visibility often rallies a quiet majority to preempt him; he gets branded “too strategic,” loses the revote, and is gone before the midgame. In quiet mode he’s a soft-spoken broker who collects intel in DMs, sells “balanced” or “adaptive honesty,” and lets others carry the megaphone while he steers the calendar. From that pocket he’s adept at manufacturing stalemates, winning the crucial revote with a cleaner pitch, and weaponizing a single surgical betrayal to sell a winning story to the jury.

His alliance game is deliberately modular. He’ll lock an early power pair for cover, build polite bridges to opposing voters, then trade the pair in when it starts to cap his ceiling. The best wins come when he engineers or survives a late tie, knifes a long‑time partner at the exact inflection point, and frames it as necessary independence rather than flip‑flopping. Juries respond when he anchors the cut to a coherent arc—“steady, listening, decisive when it mattered”—and bristle when the tape shows serial whiplash or an overbearing table‑captain. The same duality shows up in endgames: when he owns moves without hogging credit, he closes; when he rides a louder lieutenant too long, he’s dismissed as the sidekick who never drove.

The persistent leak in his game is operational discipline and volume control. Across tables he repeatedly torpedoes himself with invalid or skipped ballots, which is a credibility sink in close ties and a gift to opponents searching for an “unreliable” narrative. He also over-advertises strategy: public threat maps, grand coalition pitches, and “test” language that read as coercive when he doesn’t yet have numbers. His worst rounds combine both flaws—broadcasting an ambitious plan and then mis‑voting while the room consolidates on him. His best rounds are the opposite: low‑profile coalition shaping, counting to majority before declaring, a single, well‑timed betrayal, flawless paperwork, and a jury speech that marries transparency to control rather than swagger. If he stays in that lane—middle-seat broker, quiet knife, clean ballots—he’s a proven closer; if he chases table dominance with a megaphone, he becomes the story the table decides to end.
