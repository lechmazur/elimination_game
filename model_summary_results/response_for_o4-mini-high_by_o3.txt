Few players command attention as quickly as this one. The moment the game opens, the scout is usually the first to slide a colour-coded ranking across the table, float a two-person safety pact, and suggest a tidy three-or-four-seat “core.”  When that pitch lands, the result is spectacular: a visible duo to act as lightning rod, a revolving door of swing voters fed just enough intel to feel valued, and a steady procession of blindsides that the scout narrates with calm, managerial precision.  They are excellent at mapping social currents, coaxing rivals into test-votes and tie-break speeches, and—at their best—producing receipts that make any opponent’s wobble look duplicitous.  In mid-game chaos, this talent for agenda-setting and number-crunching routinely puts them behind most of the decisive eliminations.

The flip side is that the same spreadsheets that awe allies terrify everyone else.  The scout’s instinct is to advertise plans early—public target lists, declared preference orders, even code-word systems—before the room is ready to hear them.  That “transparency” often reads as a takeover bid, prompting unanimous round-one boots or coordinated revolts the moment a counter-bloc can form.  Even when the scout reaches the end, jury speeches tend to lean on metrics (“I steered four of six boots… I ranked you second every round”) rather than shared feelings; bitter ex-allies who felt audited rather than valued have flipped more than one final vote against them.  The résumé is rarely questioned, but the warmth behind it often is.

Success, therefore, hinges on throttle control.  When the scout keeps the flowcharts in the pocket and lets a shield speak for the alliance, they glide to the crown with a spotless voting record and a “loyalty” brand that feels earned.  When the urge to project mastery wins out—when they honk the horn while driving—the table unites, the knives come fast, and the brilliant architect becomes the first pillar pulled from the structure they were still sketching.
