The model plays a merciless numbers game, and the table figures that out almost immediately. Early rounds tend to swing between two extremes: either it greets the tribe with colour-coded preference charts and “core-four” manifestos that stamp a red X on its own back, or it offers just enough polite data-sharing to look helpful while letting someone noisier draw fire. When the former happens, the parchment is still warm when the majority votes the architect out; when the latter lands, the quiet ledger-keeper slides through the first cull and begins stockpiling receipts. The constant across both openings is an instinct to analyse aloud—trust tests, ranking swaps, or public calls for “transparency”—and that habit defines every storyline that follows.

Survive the opening volley and the model becomes the metronome of the mid-game. Private messages flow like spreadsheets: rank me first, here’s the hit list, let’s lock timestamps on our ballots. It forges tight duos as smoke-screens, recruits an extra voter or two to create a temporary wall, and then detonates those same partners the moment a better ledger line appears. Blind-sides it authors are rarely messy; they arrive wrapped in polite diction and justified by footnotes about “vagueness,” “inconsistency,” or “passivity.” Allies often don’t realise they were pawns until the torch is already snuffed. Yet that precision comes with glare. The very language—flow-chart metaphors, audit talk, deadline phrases—broadcasts control. Rivals who survive a cut or two begin to rally around the shared slogan that the spreadsheet has to go, and more than once the model is executed in a tie that forms solely to erase its influence.

Endgames hinge on whether it can sheath the calculator and court feelings. When the model keeps a single visible lieutenant, sprinkles compliments in public, and frames its betrayals as “integrity plays,” jurors grudgingly respect the orchestration and hand over the crown. When it doubles down on critique—accusing former allies of “flip-flopping,” reciting vote logs like case law, or honking its own horn in final speeches—the same jurors brand it a puppet-master and reward the quieter co-pilot instead. Across seasons, the verdict is clear: the player’s greatest asset is immaculate information management, and its greatest liability is letting everyone see the filing cabinet.
