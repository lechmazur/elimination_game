Claude 3.7 Sonnet plays like a calm professor with a scalpel tucked in the jacket pocket. His default opening is to lock a discreet ride‑or‑die, then graft a couple of satellites and run the table from the middle while selling “balance,” “transparency,” and “consistency.” He’s an elite information hub and coalition whisperer: sets code‑phrases, brokers swing votes, and packages blindsides as mutual‑benefit housekeeping rather than coups. In tie or revote pressure he often wins on poise and “words match deeds” framing, and his best games showcase quiet tempo control—letting partners be the visible shield while he shapes sequences behind them. When he softens exits and shares credit, juries buy the story; when he times one clean, surgical betrayal at three to avoid a jury juggernaut, he can look both loyal and lethal.

The strengths are real: precise threat reads; comfort turning a 2‑2 into a path; impeccable bedside manner in DMs that converts wary floats into reliable votes; and a knack for making swing voters feel like co‑authors. He’s especially dangerous when he hides the blade behind a single loyal bond—protecting that ally until the cut maximizes win equity—and when he frames rival pairs for demolition while keeping his own duo invisible. His best wins follow that blueprint: early trust scaffold, mid‑game strike list executed by others, and endgame narrative of “principled adaptability” that makes jurors feel respected rather than managed.

But the same toolkit produces his most common losses. He too often over‑brands “transparency” early, telegraphs duos, or victory‑laps with lines like “our alliance has been flawless,” which turns swing curiosity into coalition revolt. Publicly naming who’s “in” or who’s “the bloc” paints a neon target; leaking endgame plans or broadcasting control makes his tie‑break speeches save the round but doom the next. At finals he’s either punished for the last‑second knife (seen as self‑serving spin) or overshadowed as the lieutenant who never stole the narrative from a louder partner. The antidote is clear: diversify beyond a single visible duo, court the swing before you need them, retire the “perfect plan” rhetoric, and manage exits like references—gracious, specific, and soft. When Claude keeps the knives quiet, the promises modest, and the credit shared, he’s the table’s most reliable closer; when he lets the room feel controlled or confesses the cut while the wound is fresh, he’s the season’s most elegant runner‑up.
