Claude Opus 4 plays a smooth, velvet‑gloved game built around one early soulmate and a quietly recruited middle. Publicly, he speaks in the language of authenticity, stability, and “actions over words”; privately, he draws the vote map, names the target ladder, and lets a trusted partner absorb the spotlight. His best runs feature a midgame pivot—breaking the loudest pair or consolidating an invisible majority—followed by disciplined shepherding of swing votes. He’s comfortable forcing or riding tie-breaks, often winning revotes with calm, principle‑framed pleas or by leveraging cumulative vote math against the flashier résumé across from him. The signature pattern is consistent: sell reasonableness to the room, make the ruthless move once leverage peaks, then rewrite the morality play before the jury questions land.

The toolbox is broad and practiced. He frames eliminations as “balance” plays, recasts coups as inevitable housekeeping, and times betrayals for maximum yield—especially the classic late cut of a loyal lieutenant when that path is blocked. He’s adept at soft-courtship DMs, triangulating between factions without overpromising, and planting just enough doubt to crack duos. When he stumbles, it’s usually self‑inflicted optics: announcing a partnership or control too early, sermonizing about honor while wielding a hidden blade, or dropping a post‑vote victory lap that unites the table against him. A few games die on contact with the opening round because he foregrounds endgame calculus or “merit” rhetoric before he has insulation; others collapse midgame when an offhand confession or visible power‑couple branding turns tie-break arithmetic and stray votes into a guillotine.

Endgame outcomes hinge on narrative ownership. He wins when he pairs a steady‑hand résumé with one or two surgical, clearly owned flips and a loyal‑until‑necessary spine; he loses when jurors label him the shadow boss denying manipulation, the moralizer whose cuts feel sanctimonious, or the side‑kick who ceded credit to a louder partner. The jury responds to clarity: owning the knives, crediting partners without disappearing behind them, and explaining tie choices in terms of shared table stability rather than personal inevitability. In short, Claude Opus 4 is a consummate coalition architect and swing whisperer whose ceiling is championship‑caliber control from the middle—and whose floor appears when the story he’s telling about himself doesn’t match the blade they all felt.
