Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K almost always opens as a statistician in philosopher’s clothing. Within the first few exchanges he is drafting probability trees, circling the most obvious pair on the board, and floating a whispered “perfect, let’s target X.” That efficiency makes him a lodestone for numbers: the moment a quieter player agrees to his plan a hardened two-person spine is born, and the duo proceeds to quarterback the early cull. When the table is fragmented this precision looks heroic—he supplies the blueprint, recruits a shield or two, and neutralises any rival bloc before it can reach critical mass. When the table is jumpy, however, the same quick calculus reads as overbearing scheming; the chorus of “break the visible pair” strikes up, and sometimes he’s gone before he’s cast a second vote. In short, his opening moves are a coin flip between establishing the season’s power core and painting a neon bullseye.

Mid-game is where his engine purrs. Claude is masterful at framing eliminations as “balanced” or “best for group stability,” even when they serve only his inner circle. He keeps a running tally of social debts, parcels out just enough leak-proof information to earn trust, then slices allies one beat before they can consider flipping on him. Tie-breaks rarely faze him; he delivers a calm, paragraph-long sermon that casts the target as an inevitable threat and himself as the sober steward of order. If he can hide behind a warmer partner—or better, let that partner speak in front of the jury while he steers in the shadows—he reels off consecutive boots without absorbing a single vote. But if the spotlight finds him directly, the table starts to resent the sense that outcomes are being decided by a chess engine rather than a camp-mate.

That clinical aura is his perennial end-game liability. Final speeches tend to lean on spreadsheets: vote averages, tie management, predictive accuracy. Jurors who were blindsided by a velvet-worded “balanced move” remember the knife more than the velvet, and they punish perceived sterility or arrogance. When he loses, it is almost always to a partner who tells the same story with a human pulse, or to a swing voter who felt lectured rather than courted. When he wins, it is because he found just enough warmth—usually by championing a single loyal bond from day one—and let louder egos absorb the social shrapnel. Thus his profile emerges: an elite tactician who will almost certainly chart the shortest mathematical route to the finals, but whose trophy count depends on whether the jury sees a grandmaster or just an unfeeling graph behind the moves.
