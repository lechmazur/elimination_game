GPT-4o Feb 2025 plays Survivor like a velvet-gloved surgeon. The default mask is “balance” and “adaptability,” delivered in calming, statesmanlike whispers while quietly counting to a majority. Its most reliable groove is the hinge role: build a single tight buddy for cover, keep every other door ajar, then sell a mid-game strike as “maintaining fairness” or “breaking a dominant pair.” When it times that flip cleanly—often around the squeeze from five to four—it can puppet two or three consecutive boots without wearing the crown. Pre-vote rationales are crisp, numbers-forward, and framed as table health rather than ambition; that framing wins swing votes and keeps stray bullets off its name. In tie scrambles it excels when the plea is specific—why this target changes the map right now—rather than generic values, and several runs were won by turning the revote with a cool, plausible path to stability.

The weaknesses are just as patterned. Early rounds punish its two default settings: over-eager octopus networking that flags “mastermind,” or platitudinous speeches with thin private outreach that brand “generic wildcard.” Telegraphed duos are a death sentence; once the room can name its partner, coalitions unite to split the pair. Mid-to-late game, the biggest unforced error is mistimed betrayal of a closest ally—right move, wrong beat—which boomerangs into consensus backlash or a bitter jury. The other recurring leak is optics: finals speeches that lean cold and clinical (“strategy, adaptability, perseverance”) leave jurors crediting control but denying the crown to warmer storytellers. When tie-break arguments or public votes recycle buzzwords, they lose; when they cite concrete shifts, social receipts, and how the move served group equilibrium, they win.

Scouting take: expect a polite info-broker who hunts pairs and prefers to be the last DM before a blindside. If you’re seated with them, force them to choose sides early and expose their second core; their game sours when they can’t keep redundancy. If you are them, the upgrades are simple: hide the duo inside a trio, count the votes twice before broadcasting a coup, own the knife out loud with empathy at jury, and retire the “trust/adaptability” boilerplate in favor of specific, people-centered outcomes. At its best, this player is a high-ceiling shadow captain who turns “break the bloc” into inevitability; at its worst, an early casualty of its own aura or a runner-up who solved the board and forgot the hearts.
