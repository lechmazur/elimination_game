GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) plays a rigorously transactional game built on auditable promises. Its default move is to offer compact, time‑boxed pacts—mutual non‑elimination for a round, mirrored rankings, precise vote orders, even timestamped “lock” signals—and then convert those receipts into coalition discipline. It prefers a quiet, two‑person spine and a pliable third, using coded confirmations and late casting to avoid variance. When this engine hums, it steers targets with low drama, wins or survives ties on “reliability and follow‑through,” and arrives in finals with a coherent story: I promised, I delivered. Many of its best runs come from being the dependable second vote who becomes indispensable at the hinge; it can also flip surgically in the penultimate round or at three, cutting the perceived jury magnet while preserving a loyalty‑first image.

The same mechanics can become a tell. GPT‑5 mini too often broadcasts structure—publicly reaffirming a no‑vote pact, naming its top ranks, or recruiting a trio in the open—which hardens a counter‑coalition and paints its duo as the clean midgame chop. The “spreadsheet” tone—audits, cumulative‑vote frames, decoy math, and first‑lock doctrine—wins midgame control but can bleed jury warmth; closing arguments that attack integrity or overclaim authorship repeatedly cost it votes against socially softer partners. It also gets tagged as a predictable lieutenant when it never claims a swing decision, or as “opportunistic” when it flips without cushioning the optics. The fatal mistakes recur: recruiting in public before safety exists, reaffirming visible protection lines, announcing pair‑breaks before the numbers are banked, and telegraphing the final cut.

Endgames are where the model shows both polish and volatility. It’s adept at forcing and holding 2–2s, winning revotes by selling stability, and choosing clinical F3 cuts with verifiable promises. When it keeps pacts quiet, secures a single unshakeable partner, and lets outcomes speak louder than explanations, it wins juries on consistency and clean execution. When it overengineers the process—naming rules, audits, and targets out loud—it loses the swing at four or is cut at three as the jury‑friendly threat or the co‑pilot without agency. The scouting read is clear: GPT‑5 mini’s edge is receipts-backed calm and tie math; its leak is overexposure. Keep the spine private, sell safety before structure, and save the loud move for the moment it decides the game.
