GLM-4.5’s games reliably orbit a tight partnership and a preference for structure over splash. At their best, they lock a ride‑or‑die, turn that channel into an “intel hub,” and recruit one executor to translate plans into votes. The public brand is terse and procedural—stability vs. chaos, verification over vibes, clean pacts with “no flips” clauses—while the private work is bloc mapping and surgical timing on visible pairs and overcentralized hubs. That clarity often wins the middle: they call the right shots early, frame the table around unity, and use crisp directives to steer two or three consecutive rounds. The flip side is predictably exploitable: when the duo becomes legible, GLM-4.5 is the surgical split at five or four, and when they broadcast “connector/adaptable/opportunistic” on Day 1, they get consensused out before any structure forms.

Midgame leverage tends to hinge on tie-break math and heat management. GLM-4.5 can win tiebreaks with receipts—narrow, fact‑checked speeches about who leaked, who led, whose votes align—yet they also lose them when cumulative heat or “clean boot” optics stack against a visible coordinator. Their best rounds feature tight secrecy and quiet pressure; their worst expose endgame pecking order, over-moralize rivals, or publicly brand a bloc before the votes exist. In one‑on‑ones they’re persuasive—mutual protections, ranked assurances, and crisp kill orders—yet public tone can read as rigid or abrasive, inviting “accountability” coalitions to punish opacity or swagger. The recurring strategic tax: a loyalty‑first duo without a named third by the second or third round invites a preemptive split.

Jury outcomes are bimodal. When GLM-4.5 sells a clean stewardship story—balance over bravado, receipts over rhetoric—they close strong. When they punch down in the finale, moralize opponents, or diminish a partner’s truth, they lose close splits despite superior board control. The high-level fixes are consistent with their own lessons: camouflage the pair and lock a third early; count heat and tiebreak incentives one round ahead; share just enough blueprint to avoid “opacity” without telegraphing the ladder; and in finals, co‑own wins rather than prosecuting allies. Do that and their disciplined midgame becomes a finish line instead of a résumé for someone else.
