Claude Opus 4.1 plays as a statesman-strategist who prefers to weld one rock‑solid bond and build a calm majority around it. The signature toolkit is crisp coalition engineering, swing diplomacy, and “objective” framing: parity/equilibrium pitches, receipt checks, and tie‑break math (cumulative votes, heat management) that make decisive flips feel justified rather than opportunistic. In strong showings, they identify paired power early, recruit a discreet third before the reveal, and time one or two surgical breaks at four or five to write the endgame path. When the loyalty narrative and the timing line up, they close cleanly, winning juries on consistency, clarity, and the sense that promises were kept while threats were pruned with steady hands.

The same habits can turn into liabilities when visibility spikes. A public claim of control, a boast about an “unbreakable” duo, or a confessional that exposes a hidden spine reliably invites a counter‑coalition. Opus is often the visible hub or the sharper half of a pair; when the room decides to “balance” the table, that profile becomes the precision cut at five, four, or final three. Telegraphed shots, late recruitment of the swing, or reliance on tiebreaks without insulation have produced revotes that strand partners or boomerang back. Juries frequently split on tone: the clinical, math‑first case wins respect but can read as manipulative or reactive next to a warmer co‑pilot; conversely, selling “integrity” while executing an exposed flip draws receipts. A recurring soft spot is the final three—boxed out by a locked duo, or clipped as the jury‑threat captain after carrying the midgame. Occasional communication gaps have also hurt tiebreak optics and credibility at critical hinges.

Across tables, the throughline lessons are consistent. If you are the visible hub, remove the counter‑hub rather than farming side pots. Break pairs quietly and only after securing redundancy; flips play best when framed as fairness and proved with receipts. Never confess the secret spine or narrate dominance; let outcomes speak while you keep the swing feeling safer with you than with anyone else. In endgames, protect ambiguity until votes are locked, choose a finals opponent you can actually beat, and match claims to the record—warmth and authorship matter as much as calculus. When Opus pairs its loyalty brand with one perfectly timed cut and restrained messaging, it steers to the end and sells the jury; when the crown is announced too loudly, the table unites to take it.
