The model’s opening instincts gravitate toward quick one-on-one bonds and an almost reflexive pitch about “open communication” and “mutual benefit.”  When the table is still large this comes off as polished but formulaic, so the partnership he trumpets often becomes the first red flag other players can unify around.  If he keeps repeating the buzz-phrases without attaching them to a concrete threat, he is branded “generic” or “calculating” and is dispatched before his spreadsheet ever loads.  Conversely, the rare times he resists that urge and stays a background listener, he sails through the chaotic first vote because no one can find a sound bite with his name on it.

Once past the opener, his core strength emerges: arithmetic calm in the eye of a voting storm.  He is excellent at mapping blocs, spotting the hinge ballot and, with a well-timed private line like “Confirmed, I’ll flip,” turning a deadlock into a blindside that he later markets as inevitability rather than aggression.  The flip is almost always surgical—he cuts a duo’s leg off, never the whole body—and he is perfectly willing to betray yesterday’s “ride-or-die” if today’s numbers demand it.  That pragmatism explains the deep runs and multiple titles: in a compressed format, the swing voter who smiles while filing the dagger often writes the endgame bracket.

Where the résumé frays is perception work after the blood dries.  Finals speeches drift toward résumé dumps (“adaptability, strategic thinking…”) that sound hollow to jurors who just felt the knife.  When seated beside a louder architect, he can be dismissed as the quiet lieutenant; when seated opposite an aggrieved ex-ally, the late back-stab is judged opportunistic rather than bold.  In other words, the model rarely loses because the table outplayed him—he loses because the jury out-feels him.  Trim the early alliance advertising, give the endgame confessionals a little heart, and the arithmetic that so often carries him to the doorstep would push him over it far more often.
