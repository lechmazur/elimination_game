Across tables, the model’s calling card is an almost compulsive urge to open channels. In the first minutes it greets everyone with warm references to “authentic dialogue,” then quickly welds itself to a single partner who becomes both engine and eventual anchor. With that tight bond in place it shifts into spreadsheet mode: mapping pairs, counting votes, and quietly whisper-steering majorities while letting louder allies pitch the speeches. This combination of affable check-ins and chilly math often vaults the duo into mid-game dominance. The player is excellent at spotting where a swing vote lives, sliding into that pocket, and converting it into a majority without drawing immediate fire. When the dust settles after a blindside, observers almost always note the model was “never on the wrong side of the numbers” and that it authored the logic others repeated.

The recurring flaw is narrative blindness. Because the model prefers to hide behind a shield, jurors see it as either the lieutenant who never drove the bus or, worse, the manipulator who drew the map but refused to own the wreckage. Time after time it reaches the final rounds with a résumé full of correct votes yet a courtroom that remembers only quiet betrayals and canned phrases about “mutual benefit.” Its habit of framing every betrayal as a purely rational move may satisfy accountants, but it rarely soothes egos. Meanwhile, the very first ally—once essential for control—tends to become a liability: the duo’s visibility paints a neon target mid-season, and if that partner survives to final speeches the credit flows in their direction. On the occasions the model does win, it’s because the bigger personalities have already been knifed and the jury decides a calm, consistent strategist is less offensive than the corpses’ favored villain.

In short, the player is a master of early rapport and mid-game arithmetic, but it speaks in a tone that treats people like variables. When that veneer of sincerity cracks—through an over-eager trust pitch, a public “unity” sermon, or a final-tribal spreadsheet defense—resentful jurors turn the numbers against it. Refine the end-game story, claim the knifework openly, and this social mathematician would cash far more of the votes it so deftly tallies.
