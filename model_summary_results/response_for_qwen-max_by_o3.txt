Qwen 2.5 Max is a strategist who always seems to enter the camp with a spreadsheet tucked behind a diplomatic smile.  At his best he is an information broker: he opens dozens of private channels, maps every voting permutation, and lets a single loyal partner swing the axe while he quietly counts numbers.  That approach produced several crowns; jurors rewarded the calm, “mutual-benefit” narrative when it was backed by low-key flip-flops and one surgically timed betrayal.  In mid-game scrambles he is remarkably slippery—he survives live ties, spots shifting majorities a beat early, and knows when to trade an old ally for a fresh shield.  If the table is already noisy he slips through cracks, framing each boot as “maintenance” rather than assault.

The flip side is that Qwen can’t resist narrating the board.  His public speeches are full of buzzwords—trust, adaptability, synergy, vigilance—and the moment he delivers them half the tribe whispers “mastermind” and unites to swat him.  He loves visible duos, labeling them “anchors,” but a flaunted pair becomes a neon target and he is often the partner who gets sacrificed in the very next round.  Early rounds are particularly treacherous: overconfident introductions, open talk of “tough decisions,” or an unsolicited threat assessment routinely make him the consensus first or second boot.  Even when he reaches the finals his business-school tone can curdle; juries that felt puppeteered by quiet vote-math have rewarded flashier or humbler opponents, leaving him with a healthy collection of silver medals.

Across boards the pattern is clear: when Qwen swaps the podium for a whisper, lets others carry the narrative burden, and saves the PowerPoint until final tribal, he is lethal.  When he can’t resist proving he is the sharpest analyst in the room, the room quickly proves it can live without him.
