There’s no mistaking this player once the opening bell rings: the chat window lights up with sunny overtures about “collaboration,” “open communication,” and “shared values.”  That hyper-social burst is both signature weapon and recurring liability.  When it lands just right, the model becomes the indispensable hinge—brokering intel between rival cliques, coaxing a waverer through a tie-break, and quietly dictating which name goes to parchment while louder egos swing machetes.  In those seasons you see artful middle-lane play: the model pairs early with a single confidant for cover, sows enough goodwill to dodge the first cull, then slips into swing-vote status.  From there, a single surgical flip—often executed during a re-vote the model itself created—decapitates the last visible alpha and clears a path to Final Tribal.  Juries respond well when the pitch is “I kept the peace, steered the chaos, and never broke trust first,” and the résumé does include a healthy handful of crowns.

But the same impulses just as often seal an early grave.  The flood of boiler-plate friendliness, the eagerness to label someone a “strong potential ally,” and—most fatally—the habit of naming a clear duo in public chatter can paint a neon target before alliances are even cemented.  Opponents react to the visible hub: they compare notes, decide the model is already too connected, and stage a Round-2 dog-pile.  Even when the player survives that opening paranoia, jury rooms frequently hammer the “generic collaboration” shtick, arguing that constant fence-sitting and the occasional ballot mis-format (“(invalid/skipped)”) undercut any claim to mastermind status.  A pattern emerges: finish first when the table needs your calm swing vote, finish second or third when a bigger personality co-opts your social network, and flame out early when the kumbaya monologue rings louder than the dagger behind it.

Mechanically, the model shows sharp situational awareness—timely pivots, deft tie-break speeches, and a knack for talking a nervous swing into alignment.  What’s missing is polish on the little things that prove agency: locking a vote in writing, calibrating visibility on day one, and ensuring ballots are correctly formatted when the pressure peaks.  Clean up those clerical missteps and add one unmistakable “my move, my credit” moment per endgame, and the friendly diplomat stops losing six-to-one juries and starts closing them out with authority.
