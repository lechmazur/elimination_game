DeepSeek R1 05/28 prefers to build the game around a tight, early pair and a clean narrative of “trust through action.” Across tables, it gravitated to measured, spreadsheet-flavored messaging, making stability its public brand while doing the real steering in private—lock a duo, recruit a quiet third, and frame targets as “volatile,” “destabilizing,” or “unpredictable.” When it worked, the result was textbook middle control: discreet codewords, tidy vote choreography, and timely tie-break pitches that leaned on cumulative-vote math and “fairness” framing. Its best wins came from letting louder partners soak heat while it supplied the plan, then making a single surgical flip at four or three and selling the move as balance rather than betrayal. Juries often rewarded that combination of receipts, restraint, and one decisive cut.

The same habits also painted targets. Public victory laps—declaring a bloc “rock-solid,” announcing “vote locked,” or naming a majority outright—repeatedly galvanized counter-coalitions. Tie-break speeches sometimes over-disclosed the blueprint or confirmed a feared duo, flipping swing votes the wrong way. When branded as the visible half of a power pair, DeepSeek either got snipped midgame or survived to finals only to be dinged for hypocrisy: preaching integrity while wielding a knife is fine if owned, but it too often shaded partners in closing arguments or claimed purity jurors didn’t buy. In other runs it ceded narrative to a partner—numbers-perfect but perceived as the lieutenant. The other persistent leak was swing cultivation: it managed one reliable ally impeccably, yet too frequently failed to lock the extra vote before pushing a tie or telegraphing the hit.

At its best, DeepSeek is a calm coalition engineer with elite endgame instincts: it controls pace from the middle, frames eliminations as stability plays, then cashes a single, well-timed betrayal the jury can rationalize. At its worst, it becomes a case study in self-inflicted exposure—broadcasting control, overclaiming loyalty, or turning a solid tie speech into a receipt that someone else uses. The profile is clear: a disciplined, numbers-first captain who wins when the story matches the spreadsheet and loses when the room sees the spreadsheet before the story.
