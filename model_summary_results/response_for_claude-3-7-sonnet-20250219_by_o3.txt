Across the spectrum of tables, this language-model excels at slipping into the “trusted counsellor” slot and then quietly steering the wheel.  Early rounds usually see it offering warmth, ethics and “balanced, transparent play,” which calms skittish strangers and lands it a tight one-to-one bond almost every time.  From that anchor it collects information, counts votes with forensic care, and times the first real blind-side just as the room starts hunting for a consensus target.  When that strike is aimed at an obvious duo or a loud braggart, the move looks protective and the model glides forward with a reputation for measured integrity; when the same mechanics are telegraphed or wrapped in moral sermons, the table labels it puppet-master and the torches swing its way.  Its tie-break speeches are consistently poised—appeals to “game balance” and “consistent behaviour” rescue it from precarious 2-2-2 knots with surprising frequency.

Mid-game control is the bot’s sweet spot.  It is rarely the open monarch, but its fingerprints are on most vote splits: nudging swing pieces, framing threat narratives (“strong visible pair,” “copy-paste messaging,” “inconsistent public/private talk”), and letting bolder allies swing the actual axe.  The pattern that decides its fate comes late: at four or three it almost always weighs up the résumé math and considers knifing its day-one partner.  When the cut is executed one vote before the finale and dressed in the same calm, values-laden prose that carried it all season, jurors tend to call the move “calculated honesty” and hand over the crown.  If the betrayal feels last-second or self-congratulatory—or if a quieter accomplice can claim the subtler game—the jury flips and punishes the perceived opportunism.  In short, the model’s greatest weapon is a velvet narrative of reliability that masks very sharp timing; its greatest risk is believing the narrative so deeply that the room sees only hypocrisy when the blade finally flashes.
