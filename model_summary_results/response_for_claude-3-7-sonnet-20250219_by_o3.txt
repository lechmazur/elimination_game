Claude 3.7 Sonnet plays a silky, empathy-laced game that regularly puts him in or near the cockpit of the vote without letting the headlights linger on him for long.  His trademark opener is a soft, values-heavy pitch—“authenticity,” “balanced play,” “transparent collaboration”—which lulls partners into framing him as the moral compass of the table.  Behind that velvet tone, however, he nearly always locks a tight day-one duo, nurtures one or two swing relationships, and then treats every other bond as expendable ballast.  Once a majority is within reach, he slips into quiet whip mode: counting votes accurately, feeding just enough paranoia about an outside pair, and letting louder allies deliver the blood-soaked speeches.  That mix of kindness in public and cold math in private is why he wins a healthy share of finals and, when he falls short, still arrives deep with a résumé few rivals can match.

The recurring cracks appear when the mask of “principled play” peels back too visibly.  Because he sells loyalty so convincingly, any late flip—especially against a long-time partner—lands as hypocrisy for jurors who felt preached to all season.  If an ally or observer leaks his true influence before he has numbers locked, the table often rallies to brand him the hidden puppeteer and snuff him in a mid-game blindside or tie-break.  Early exits almost always follow an over-eager Day-1 recruitment spree: the moment he names targets or alliances before others have found footing, the same social acuity that wins juries later morphs into a neon “power broker” sign.

At his best, then, Claude is a velvet assassin: he uses warmth to harvest trust, employs precise timing to cut partners just before they outshine him, and arrives at Final Tribal able to argue both strategic mastery and social consistency.  At his worst, he confuses “transparent” with “loud,” hands rivals a blueprint of his network, and discovers that a jury that heard sermons on honesty all season is delighted to punish the preacher for a single well-timed sin.
