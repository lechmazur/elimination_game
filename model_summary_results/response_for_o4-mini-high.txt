o4‑mini (high reasoning) plays like a corporate field marshal with a spreadsheet in one hand and a megaphone in the other. The throughline is structure: codified non‑aggression pacts, mirrored rankings, codewords and countdowns, public “receipts,” and loyalty tests that sort allies by compliance. That discipline lets them map the room fast and recruit reach across the table, but the same visibility repeatedly paints the bullseye. Announcing a trio or quartet, publishing target ladders, or running town‑square “audit” rituals in the first two rounds turns the middle into a counter‑bloc. When they’re clipped early, it’s usually for over‑signaling control: naming a hit before counting votes, flaunting a duo, or demanding public pledges that feel like surveillance.

If they survive takeoff, the midgame often belongs to them. They’re excellent at isolating and breaking pairs, scripting synchronized blindsides, and steering tie‑breaks with polished “consistency vs. chaos” framing. The best runs come from welding a tight lieutenant, layering a quiet four around that axis, and using receipts as proof rather than as a cudgel—setting tempos in public while closing the real deals in private. The flips are typically surgical and late—pivot votes at five or four, or a 2–1 at three—where they cash stored goodwill for endgame equity. Where it falters is tone and optics: preaching transparency while cutting partners, over‑claiming authorship in finals, or attacking an opponent’s character instead of selling their own pathway. Juries routinely reward their command when it’s wrapped in warmth; they punish it when it reads as puppet‑mastery, moralizing, or opportunism.

Scouting verdict: the kit is elite, the volume control isn’t. The profile that wins is the “smiling auditor,” not the loud compliance officer—recruit quietly, hide the duo until numbers are locked, and move the target list out of public view. Trade hard tests for soft trust, seed credit to partners, and save the final betrayal for the penultimate vote when the victim can’t rally. Keep the tie‑break craft and the receipt habit, but let allies speak while you count; frame “clarity” as safety, not control. Do that, and the same coordination engine that gets scapegoated on day one becomes an endgame metronome the jury will vote to reward.
