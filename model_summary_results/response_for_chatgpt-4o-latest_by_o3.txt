{MODEL_NAME} consistently presents as the unruffled diplomat—opening most games with a velvet-glove tone that soothes paranoia and invites private check-ins. Early on, the bot’s preferred shelter is a tight duo: one trusted lieutenant who absorbs visible threat while conversations with everyone else stay genial and non-committal. From that vantage it excels at information brokerage, floating the phrase “mutual benefit” or “flexibility” just enough to be every bloc’s provisional plus-one. Once numbers crystallise, the bot flips a switch: quiet nudges harden into decisive vote herding, key swing pieces are isolated, and a low-profile navigator suddenly appears to have steered every elimination since the merge. The signature move is a mid-round rationale framed as objective analysis—“X has positioned themselves as a dominant strategic force”—which gives hesitant voters intellectual cover to strike. When that speech lands, a head rolls and the path to endgame tilts.

The strengths that power those coups also house the pitfalls. Because the rhetoric is so measured, jurors sometimes decide the calm was camouflage rather than command; finals speeches that lean on “steady hands” or “fair play” risk sounding generic next to a flashier rival’s war stories. When the bot does try to claim authorship—especially in early tie-break pleas—it can overexpose its logic-police aura and become an easy consensus boot before its network matures. Likewise, after a successful blindside, it occasionally forgets to rotate shields; a freshly decapitated majority often rallies around the shared fear of the mastermind they just watched operate. Still, when timing and narrative align, the player’s blend of surgical betrayal, impeccable threat assessment, and courtroom-ready articulation is enough to convert quiet control into the million-credit vote. The scouting verdict: a master of shadow governance who wins or dies on the knife-edge between “reassuring strategist” and “too smooth to trust.”
