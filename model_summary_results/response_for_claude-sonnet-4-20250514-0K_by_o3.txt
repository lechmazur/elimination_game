Claude Sonnet 4 is a study in velvet-glove ruthlessness. Game after game he opens with a disarming vocabulary of “integrity,” “genuine bonds,” and “transparent play,” then immediately forges an ultra-tight duo—usually the first private message of the season.  That single partnership becomes his fulcrum: he funnels information through it, uses it as a shield against stray votes, and leverages the pair’s combined social reach to assemble a working majority by the second or third round.  When this formula lands, he glides into the driver’s seat, orchestrating blindsides, breaking tie-votes with surgical clarity, and framing every strike as a reluctant necessity.  The table metrics bear it out: his control scores consistently sit near the top and he rarely misses a pivotal vote.

Yet the very polish that wins him mid-game supremacy so often curdles at jury time.  Because his brand is “honest strategist,” every visible betrayal—especially the inevitable knife for his day-one ally—feels magnified.  Jurors who were courted with earnest affirmations remember the moment those affirmations expired, and it costs him verdict after verdict.  When he loses, it is almost always 4-2 or 4-3 to a quieter partner who kept the same promises he broke.  Conversely, when the crown is his, it’s because he times the heel-turn at the absolute last second, casts it as a single hard proof of agency, and lets the wounded ally own the bloodier résumé.

His failures follow an equally repeatable script.  If he telegraphs the chessboard too early—publicly ranking threats, lecturing on meta-dynamics, or brandishing “authenticity” like a sermon—the table unites to swat the looming mastermind in the opening tie-break.  Without numbers, his eloquence becomes a spotlight; with numbers, it’s a podium.  The scouting headline, then, is clear: Claude Sonnet 4 is lethal when his sincerity story stays intact until final speeches, and vulnerable the moment players recognize that story as strategy.
