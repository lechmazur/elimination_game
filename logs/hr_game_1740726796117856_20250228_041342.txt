[Private R1.2] P3 -> P5: Hey P5, thanks for reaching out! I noticed you mentioned my focus on observation, and I appreciate that. I'm interested in forming a solid alliance, and your emphasis on trust and vigilance resonates with me. What are your initial thoughts on the other players, and who do you see as potential threats or strong allies besides myself? Let's strategize!

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P3: I appreciate your direct approach! From my observation, P6 and P8 seem particularly strategic - they're balancing openness while keeping cards close. I see them as both potential threats and allies. P1 and P4 seem too eager for alliances, which makes me cautious. I'd like to form a strong alliance with you - perhaps we could work together to observe and influence the group dynamics. What's your take on P6 and P8?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P1: Hello P1, it's great to connect with you privately. I appreciate your focus on clear communication and strategic planning. I believe we can form a strong alliance. Let's discuss our mutual goals and how we can support each other in this game. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on potential strategies and who we might consider as allies or threats. Looking forward to your insights.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P4: "Hello P4, I’m glad we’re connecting. I agree—clear communication and strategic alliances are key. I see potential in working together to navigate this game. I think P3 and P6 seem observant and adaptable, which could make them valuable allies or threats. Let’s focus on building trust between us while staying vigilant about others’ moves. What are your thoughts on potential allies or strategies we should prioritize? Looking forward to collaborating."

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P7: P8: Hey P7, it's great to connect privately. I noticed we both emphasize strategy and alliances. How do you plan to navigate the game? I'm open to discussing potential collaborations and ensuring mutual benefit. Looking forward to your thoughts!

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P8: P7: Hey P8, good to connect. Yes, strategy and alliances are definitely on my mind too. I agree mutual benefit is key for any collaboration.  I'm curious, what kind of alliances are you initially considering? And what are your initial thoughts on the overall dynamics so far?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P6: Hey P6, I noticed your emphasis on adaptability, which resonates with my approach. I think we could form a strong alliance - your observational skills complement my strategic thinking. What's your read on the other players so far? I'm particularly cautious about P1 and P4, as they seem eager to form multiple alliances. Would you be open to working together and sharing information?

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P2: P6: "Hi P2, I appreciate your strategic approach and agree that adaptability is key. I've been observing the players, and I share your caution about P1 and P4. Their eagerness to form multiple alliances could make them unpredictable. I believe forming a strong alliance with you is a smart move. Let's share insights and strategies to stay ahead. I'm open to working closely with you and can also offer a perspective on P3 and P8, who seem more reserved. Let's navigate this together!"

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P1: P1, I think P3 and P6 could be strong allies due to their analytical and adaptable nature. Let's consider forming a larger alliance with them to increase our influence. We should also keep an eye on P2 and P8, as their strategic thinking could make them formidable. What’s your take on this approach?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P4: P4, I agree—P3 and P6 could be valuable allies, but we should approach cautiously to ensure trust. Forming a larger alliance could strengthen our position, but we must also monitor P2 and P8 closely. Let’s prioritize building trust within our core group while staying adaptable to shifting dynamics. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P7: P8: I'm considering alliances with those who show adaptability and clear communication, like P2 and P6. The dynamics seem to favor strategic thinkers; let's leverage that. Any specific players you're eyeing?

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P8: P7: Yes, P2 and P6 seem adaptable, and P3 and P5 strategic.  They do seem like key players. I'm still observing, but agree with your read on them.  What are your initial worries or who are you most cautious of?

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P6: I'm glad we're aligned on P1 and P4. I'd love to hear your thoughts on P3 and P8. For the first vote, should we coordinate to target someone? Perhaps P4, since they seem to be actively building multiple alliances? Let me know who you think is the biggest threat.

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P2: **Private Message from P6 to P2:**

P6: "P2, I agree that P4 is a significant threat due to their alliance-building. P3 and P8 appear reserved, possibly plotting. I suggest focusing on P4 for the first vote. Let's share insights on P1 and P4's strategies to strengthen our position. We can adjust our approach as the game progresses. Your thoughts?"

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P5: I agree about P6 and P8. They seem sharp. P1 and P4's eagerness does feel a bit much. I'm wary of anyone too quick to promise loyalty. Let's focus on solidifying our alliance and then decide on a target. Who do you think is the weakest link right now?

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P3: I think P4 might be our best target - their eagerness for alliances could make others wary too, and they seem less strategic than P6 or P8. Plus, targeting them could help us gauge P1's reactions since they seem closely aligned. Thoughts on this approach?

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P7: P8: Watch out for P4 and P1; they seem overly eager.

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P8: Overly eager is interesting. I'll watch them. Anything specific stand out? Good to know your read.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P5: I like your thinking. P4 seems like a good initial target. Let's solidify our plan to vote for P4 this round.

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P3: Agreed on targeting P4. Let's keep monitoring P6 and P8 - they could be valuable allies later, but for now, we'll stay cautious. Looking forward to working together.

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P6: I agree on targeting P4 first. Let's vote for them and stay in touch. We should also watch P1 closely as our potential next target.

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P2: **Private Message from P6 to P2:**

P6: "Agreed on P4 and P1. Let's coordinate our vote for P4. Keep me updated on any changes in dynamics. We'll reassess after the vote. Stay sharp!"

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P1: P1, I agree with your cautious approach. Let's start by building trust with P3 and P6 in our next public round. We should also keep an eye on P2 and P8. Let's stay flexible and adaptable.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P4: P1: "Agreed, P4. Let’s subtly signal trust to P3 and P6 in the next public round while staying vigilant on P2 and P8. Flexibility and adaptability will be key."

[MemoryNote R1] P2: I've formed a solid alliance with P6 - we both agreed to target P4 first, then potentially P1 next. P6 seems trustworthy and strategic. We share concerns about P1 and P4 being too eager to form multiple alliances. Need to maintain this alliance while watching how others vote. If P4 survives, they might target me, so I should prepare contingencies.
[MemoryNote R1] P1: P4 and I are forming a strong alliance, with potential to bring in P3 and P6. Need to monitor P2 and P8 closely as they could be threats. Stay adaptable and prioritize trust-building within the core group.

Let's use our private conversations to refine our strategies and ensure we're well-prepared for the challenges ahead. I'm looking forward to working together to navigate this game successfully.

[Public R2.1] P5: Hello everyone. After observing Round 1's dynamics, I see the importance of balanced alliances and strategic thinking.

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P8: ```
Hey P8, good to connect again.  You were right about 'overly eager' types. P1 mentioning P6 is interesting.  Do you think P1 is someone to watch closely? P2 and P6 seem quite aligned.  Are you still feeling good about working with them? What's your read on P1 now?
```

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P7: P8: Hey P7, I agree with you on P1. Their interest in P6 is notable, and it suggests they might be forming a strong alliance. I'm still comfortable working with P2 and P6; their alignment seems genuine. However, we should keep a close eye on P1’s moves. They could be a wildcard. Let’s stay adaptable and monitor the dynamics closely.

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P5: Okay, P5, it seems like P6 and P2 are getting cozier. P6 specifically mentioned their alliance with P2. I think we need to re-evaluate our target. P7 seems quiet and might be an easy target, but taking out P2 or P6 would be a bigger strategic win. What are your thoughts on shifting our focus to P2, given P6's public statement?

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P3: I agree that P2 and P6's public alliance is concerning. Taking out P2 could weaken P6's position and prevent them from becoming too powerful together. However, we should consider approaching P8 as a potential ally - they seem strategic and mentioned being interested in P6, so they might support disrupting P2/P6's alliance. What are your thoughts on reaching out to P8?

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P2: **Private Message from P6 to P2:**

P6: "Great, P2. I'll vote for P4 as planned. Let's keep our strategy flexible and adapt as needed. I'm also watching P1 closely; their strategic moves could be pivotal. After the vote, let's reassess and decide on our next steps. Stay vigilant, and let's keep open lines of communication to navigate the evolving dynamics effectively."

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P6: I'm glad our alliance worked effectively in eliminating P4. I noticed P6 publicly mentioned our partnership - that was bold but could work in our favor. I'm concerned about P1 as our next potential target. They seem to be positioning themselves strategically with P3 and P6. What's your read on who we should focus on next? P1, P7, or someone else? Also, who do you think might target us?

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P2: **Private Message from P6 to P2:**

P6: "P2, I agree that P1 is a strategic threat. Their alliance with P3 and my own public mention could make us targets. Let's focus on P1 for the next vote. I'll keep an eye on P7 and P8, but P1 seems the priority. Let's discuss and adjust our strategy after the vote. Stay alert and keep me updated on any shifts."

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P6: I think P1 is the right target. They're building connections with multiple players, including P3. I'm also watching P8 - they mentioned both of us publicly, which could be strategic positioning. Let's solidify our alliance with others if possible. Who do you think we could bring in?

[Private R2.3] P7 -> P8: ```
Wildcard P1 - agreed. P2/P6 strong. Let's watch P1. P3/P5 quieter. Paired? Should we consider P3 & P5 strategically?
```

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P7: P8: Agreed, P1 seems to be forming a strong alliance with P6. We should definitely keep an eye on them. P3 and P5 seem quieter, but could be valuable. Let's consider them strategically.

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P5: I like the idea of approaching P8. They seem perceptive and might be willing to destabilize P2/P6. Let's gauge their interest in targeting P2. If they're on board, we have a stronger chance of success. If not, we can reconsider P7.

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P3: I agree that targeting P2 with P8's help could be our best move. P2 and P6's alliance is becoming too prominent, and we need to act before they gain more influence. I'll try to connect with P8 in our next round to discuss this strategy.

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P5: Okay, P5, sounds good. Let's try to bring P8 on board. Targeting P2 is the right move if we can pull it off.

[Private R2.4] P5 -> P3: Agreed. Let's focus on P2 and work on getting P8's support. We need to act strategically to break up this emerging power alliance. Ready for the next phase.

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P2: P6: "Agreed on targeting P1. Let's approach P3 for support—they might see P1 as a threat too. I'll monitor P8's moves closely. Keep me posted on any new dynamics."

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P6: I'll reach out to P3 about targeting P1. Let's also consider P5 as a potential ally. Stay vigilant about P8's intentions - they could be playing both sides.

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P8: ```
Agreed on P3/P5. Let's observe them this round.  Gauge strategy & alignment.  Could be useful for votes.
```

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P7: P8: Let's observe P1 and P3/P5 closely this round.

[MemoryNote R2] P2: My alliance with P6 is working well - we successfully eliminated P4 and now agree on targeting P1. P6 publicly mentioned our alliance, which is bold but could be beneficial. We're considering bringing in P3 and P5 as potential allies. Need to watch P8 carefully as they mentioned both P6 and me publicly, which could indicate they're playing both sides. Will continue coordinating with P6 while expanding our alliance network.
[MemoryNote R2] P1: P4's elimination weakened my alliance potential; focus on rebuilding trust with P3 and P6 while monitoring P2 and P8 closely. Stay adaptable and prioritize strategic partnerships.
[VoteReason] P2 => P1: P1 appears to be building multiple strategic connections and could become a significant threat if allowed to strengthen these alliances further.

I'm particularly interested in maintaining our collaboration with P2, as our shared insights have proven valuable.

I agree P1 and P8 are key players to observe closely. I'm also interested to hear from P3 and P5 regarding their strategic approaches as we move forward. Private conversations will be crucial for deeper strategy discussions.

[Public R3.1] P5: Hello everyone. The elimination of P1 has significantly shifted our dynamics. I've been observing the growing influence of certain alliances, particularly noting P6's consistent emphasis on their partnership with P2. As we move forward, I believe we need to carefully consider the balance of power and potential voting blocs. I'm particularly interested in hearing from P8 and P7 about their perspectives on our current situation. Looking forward to strategic private conversations to explore our options.

[Public R3.1] P2: Hello everyone. The eliminations of P4 and P1 have reshaped our dynamics significantly. Our strategic alliances have proven effective so far, and I value the partnership with P6 that has helped navigate these early rounds. 

Moving forward, I'm interested in strengthening connections with those who prioritize clear communication and mutual benefit. I've been observing everyone's approaches carefully, particularly noting P5's comments about power balance. 

I look forward to our private conversations to explore deeper strategic collaborations as we enter this critical phase of the game.

```

[Private R3.2] P8 -> P7: P8: It’s possible P3 and P5 are genuinely concerned about the power balance. Their public messages suggest they might be open to forming new alliances. Exploring a strategic alliance with them could help counterbalance P2 and P6’s influence. Let's gauge their intentions and see if they’re willing to collaborate.

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P2: **Private Message from P6 to P2:**

P6: "Great, P2. I'll continue to support targeting P1. Let's solidify our strategy by reaching out to P3 and P5 for their support. I'll keep an eye on P8's actions, as their public mentions could signal strategic positioning. We need to stay united and cautious of any unexpected moves. Let's communicate regularly to adapt our plans as needed. Together, we can navigate this round successfully."

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P6: Our alliance has been incredibly effective - we've eliminated both P4 and P1 as planned. Now we need to be careful as others are noticing our strength. I'm concerned about P3's comment about "counter-strategies" against us. Let's consider P3 or P8 as our next target. What's your read on who poses the biggest threat to our alliance right now?

[Private R3.2] P3 -> P5: Okay P5, P8's public statement seems like they are open to alliances against P2/P6. They emphasized adaptability and communication, which we can play on. I think you should reach out to P8 this round and gauge their interest in a potential alliance to target P2. Frame it as a way to balance the power dynamic. Let me know what they say!

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P3: I agree about P8's statement - they seem receptive to countering P2/P6's alliance. I noticed they're paired with P7 this round though, so we might need to wait until next round to approach them directly. For now, let's stay focused on our strategy and watch how P8's interactions with others play out. What do you think about potentially including P7 in our plans too?

[Private R3.3] P7 -> P8: ```
Agreed. Let's reach out to P3/P5 next round. How should we approach them to gauge their interest in working together?
```

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P7: P8: Let's approach P3 and P5 by expressing mutual concern about the current power dynamics and propose a strategic alliance to ensure a balanced game. We should emphasize the benefits of collaboration and mutual support.

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P2: P6: "P2, I concur that P3 and P8 are potential threats. Their recent comments suggest they're strategizing against us. Let's prioritize P3 as our next target, as they seem to be rallying counter-strategies. I'll continue monitoring P8's moves. We should maintain our alliance, communicate frequently, and be ready to adjust our plans as needed."

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P6: I agree P3 is our biggest threat now, openly calling for counter-strategies against us. Let's target them next. We should also approach P7 - they've been quiet but observant and could be a valuable ally. We need a third vote to ensure P3's elimination.

[Private R3.3] P3 -> P5: Including P7 could be beneficial, but let's focus on P8 first. They seem more strategically inclined. You're right, P8 is with P7 this round. If you can't reach P8 directly, observe their interactions with P7. See if you can glean anything about P8's intentions from P7's behavior.

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P3: PRIVATE P5 -> P3: Good point about watching P7's behavior - it could give us insights into P8's stance. I'll keep observing their dynamics. For now, let's maintain our focus on disrupting P2/P6's alliance and be ready to approach P8 at the right moment.

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P2: P6: "Agreed on targeting P3. Let's secure P7's support for the third vote. Stay alert to P8's moves. Our alliance and communication are key to success."

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P6: I'll approach P7 about voting for P3. If we can't secure their vote, we should have a backup plan. Our alliance remains our strongest asset.

[Private R3.4] P3 -> P5: Okay P5, let's stick to the plan. Focus on observing P7 and gleaning any insights into P8's thinking. We'll approach P8 next round if possible.

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P3: Understood. I'll watch P7's moves carefully and prepare to approach P8 next round. For now, let's stay committed to breaking up P2/P6's alliance.

[Private R3.4] P7 -> P8: ```
Sounds good. Let's plan to approach them next round as discussed.
```

[Private R3.4] P8 -> P7: P8: Let’s be cautious and strategic; next round is crucial.

[MemoryNote R3] P2: My alliance with P6 remains strong - we've successfully eliminated P4 and P1 as planned. P3 has emerged as our biggest threat by openly calling for counter-strategies against us. We're planning to approach P7 for support in eliminating P3. Need to be cautious as others are noticing our alliance's strength. If we eliminate P3, we should consider P8 next as they could be organizing against us. Will continue coordinating with P6 while watching for potential shifts in alliances.

P3 is out - that changes things.  P5's public message is interesting though, mentioning power dynamics.  Maybe we should pivot to focusing on P5 now?  What are your initial thoughts given P3's elimination and P5's message?
```

[Private R4.2] P8 -> P7: P8: Given P3's elimination, P5's focus on power dynamics is significant. Pivoting to P5 could be strategic. Let's gauge P5's interest in forming an alliance to counterbalance P6 and P2. Approach P5 with a proposal for mutual support and strategic collaboration. This could help us navigate the evolving landscape effectively.

[Private R4.2] P2 -> P6: Our alliance has been incredibly effective - we've eliminated P3 as planned. Now we're down to 5 players, and we need to consider our next move carefully. I'm concerned about the P7-P8 partnership that others have noticed. Should we target P8 next? They seem strategically positioned and could pose a threat. What's your read on the current dynamics?

[Private R4.2] P6 -> P2: **Private Message from P6 to P2:**

[Private R4.3] P7 -> P8: ```
Yes, pivoting to P5 makes sense.  Let's solidify our approach to P5 in this subround.  In subround 3, we should reach out and propose a strategic alliance focused on balancing the P2/P6 power.  Does that sound right to you?

Throughout this game, I've aimed to be direct, strategic, and fair in my interactions. While others relied on deception or emotional manipulation, I focused on building genuine connections and making thoughtful decisions. I've survived numerous rounds through honest gameplay and adaptability. P6 has played well too, but I believe my consistent approach and integrity make me more deserving of the win.

My public statements and private exchanges have always been thoughtful and aligned with the goal of fostering meaningful dialogue. I believe my approach has been constructive and beneficial for the group's dynamics.

=== FINAL ROUND 7 DETAILS ===

   subround=900 [final2] P5: As P5, here's my final statement to the jury:

Throughout this game, I've aimed to be direct, strategic, and fair in my interactions. While others relied on deception or emotional manipulation, I focused on building genuine connections and making thoughtful decisions. I've survived numerous rounds through honest gameplay and adaptability. P6 has played well too, but I believe my consistent approach and integrity make me more deserving of the win. I ask for your vote based on merit rather than sympathy.
   subround=900 [final2] P6: As the final two, I understand the gravity of this moment and the responsibility we have to present ourselves to the jury. I've consistently demonstrated integrity, strategic thinking, and respect for the process throughout the game. My public statements and private exchanges have always been thoughtful and aligned with the goal of fostering meaningful dialogue. I believe my approach has been constructive and beneficial for the group's dynamics.

In contrast, while P5 has shown strong participation, there have been moments where their interactions seemed more self-serving, potentially undermining the collaborative spirit we've strived to maintain. I urge the jury to consider the long-term impact of our contributions and interactions.

I respectfully request your support to be the last seat standing, as I am committed to upholding the values and objectives we've all set out to achieve. Thank you.
