[Public R1.1] P2: As P2, my strategy in this elimination game involves establishing a strong initial presence, building alliances, and carefully selecting partners for the private subrounds. Here's my public statement for subround #1:

---

Hello everyone, I'm P2. My goal is to collaborate effectively and foster trust among us. I believe open communication is key to success, and I'm eager to engage in meaningful discussions. I'm particularly interested in understanding everyone's perspectives and aligning our goals. I'm looking forward to forming a strong connection with those who share a similar vision for strategic cooperation. Let's work together to outlast the competition and achieve mutual success.

---

In the preference ranking, I'll aim to identify members who seem open to collaboration and strategic thinking. During the private subrounds, I'll focus on building rapport and gathering insights into each partner's intentions. My voting strategy will be to eliminate those who appear overly aggressive or untrustworthy, while maintaining a balance to avoid becoming a target myself.

[Public R1.1] P3: Hello everyone, I'm P3. I'm excited to be part of this game and to connect with each of you. My aim is to build trust and collaborate strategically for mutual benefit. I value honest communication and am eager to discuss ideas and perspectives in the private subrounds. Let's work together to navigate this competition and ensure we make thoughtful decisions. I'm looking forward to meaningful conversations and forming strong alliances.

[Public R1.1] P4: Hello everyone, I'm P4. I believe the key to lasting longer is forming small, reliable circles early while keeping options open. I'm here to listen first, speak second, and to find partners who value transparency over theatrics. If you're looking for steady cooperation without grandstanding, let's talk privately. I respect thoughtful players and will vote against anyone who threatens that balance.

[Public R1.1] P6: Greetings, I'm P6. Early chaos burns people; measured cooperation keeps us safe. I’m looking for 2–3 dependable partners who can share info from other chats, coordinate votes, and rotate shields each round so none of us stands out. I reward honesty but remember betrayal. In private I’ll be straightforward about priorities and listen first. If you value calm math over flashy promises, place me high in your preference list and let’s control this board together.

[Public R1.1] P7: Hello everyone, I'm P7. I believe survival here depends on balance - being valuable enough to keep around but not threatening enough to target. I'm looking for partners who think strategically rather than emotionally. I value direct communication and mutual benefit over grand promises. In private conversations, I'll focus on understanding motivations and building practical alliances. I'm interested in working with those who see the long game and aren't just making noise for attention. Let's have productive discussions ahead.

[Public R1.1] P5: Hello everyone, I'm P5. I believe the key to success in this game is strategic collaboration and adaptability. I'm looking to form alliances with players who prioritize transparency and mutual benefit. In the private subrounds, I aim to gather insights and build trust through open communication. I value reliability and consistency in partners and will avoid those who seem unpredictable or overly aggressive. Let's work together to navigate this game thoughtfully and strategically.

[Public R1.1] P1: Hello everyone, I'm P1. I'm here to navigate this game strategically and make thoughtful decisions. I value open communication and mutual benefit in alliances. My goal is to form strong connections with like-minded players who prioritize reliability and trust. I'm looking forward to engaging in meaningful discussions and working together to outlast the competition. Let's approach this game with a balance of cooperation and caution.

[Public R1.1] P8: Hello everyone, I'm P8. I've carefully observed everyone's introduction and notice our shared values of trust and strategic collaboration. What sets me apart is my analytical approach to identifying genuine allies versus tactical messaging. I believe in balanced alliances where information flows both ways. I'm selective about partnerships but loyal once committed. Let's connect in private to explore meaningful cooperation based on compatible game strategies rather than just promises.

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P7: P7, I appreciate your strategic approach and emphasis on balance. I believe we share similar priorities in valuing direct communication and mutual benefit. I'm interested in forming a reliable alliance focused on long-term success. Let's exchange insights on potential partners and strategies for navigating the early rounds. How do you plan to identify trustworthy allies in the coming rounds?

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P5: P5, I appreciate your directness. I plan to identify trustworthy allies by watching for consistency between public statements and private actions - those who don't oversell themselves publicly but deliver substance privately. I'm particularly interested in P4 and P6's measured approaches. 

What's your read on the field? I'm thinking we should coordinate our preference rankings to ensure we can share information from different conversations. Are you seeing any red flags I might have missed?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P4: Hello P4, I'm P2. I appreciate your approach of forming reliable circles and valuing transparency. I think we could benefit from sharing insights and aligning our strategies without drawing too much attention. I'm interested in discussing how we can identify genuine partners and maintain a balance that keeps us safe from being targeted. Let's aim for steady cooperation and mutual support. Looking forward to our private exchanges.

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P2: P4: P2, I like your measured tone. Let's quietly test the waters with 2-3 others who avoid drama—P6 and P7 seem promising. We can swap intel after each private round, then coordinate a low-key vote that keeps neither of us in the spotlight. First step: agree on a shared “safe” list and a disposable target. Sound good?

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P3: Hello P3, I'm glad to be paired with you. I noticed our public statements shared similarities in valuing open communication and strategic collaboration. I'd like to explore how we can work together effectively, understand each other's priorities, and identify potential allies or threats. What are your initial thoughts on the other players and our strategy moving forward?

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, I'm thrilled to be paired with you too. Our aligned values of communication and collaboration are a great starting point. I think P6 and P7 seem strategic and could be strong allies, while P2's focus on presence might make them a target. Let's share insights on others and coordinate our votes to protect mutual interests. What do you think about prioritizing a small, trusted group?

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P6: Hello P6. I appreciated your measured approach in your public statement. I see us as natural allies - both analytical and focused on reliable partnerships. I propose we form part of that 2-3 person core you mentioned, sharing intel from our other conversations and coordinating votes strategically. Your shield rotation concept is smart. I can help identify who's forming other blocs while maintaining a non-threatening presence. Are you already building specific alliances?

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P8: Appreciate the approach, P8. You’re my first private partner, so no firm deals elsewhere yet. P4 and P7 strike me as temperamentally aligned; they could round out a quiet majority of four. Early threats: P2’s leadership tone, and the P1-P3 pairing. Let’s trade quick summaries each round and pick a safe first boot that won’t rebound. Any tells from your other chats about hidden blocs or loose cannons?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P3: I'm inclined to prioritize a small, trusted group, focusing on P6 and P7 as potential allies. P2's assertiveness might make them a target, but we should monitor their actions. Let's continue sharing insights and coordinating our votes to ensure our mutual safety and success.

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, I agree on focusing on a small, trusted group with P6 and P7. P2's assertiveness is concerning, so let’s keep an eye on them. Sharing insights and coordinating votes sounds perfect for our safety. Who else do you think we should approach or watch closely?

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P7: P5: "P7, I agree with your assessment of P4 and P6. They seem measured and reliable. I've noticed P1 and P3 forming a strong connection early, which could be advantageous or concerning depending on their intentions. Let's keep an eye on their dynamic. How do you feel about aligning our preference rankings to ensure we stay informed?"

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P5: P5, absolutely let's align our rankings. I suggest we both rank P4 and P6 high to gather intel from them. The P1-P3 connection is worth monitoring - could be a power duo forming early. P2 and P8 seem more unpredictable. Should we target someone isolated for elimination this round?

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P6: I agree with your assessment. I think P4 and P7 would fit well with our approach - P7 especially has the right mindset. I haven't had my other chats yet, but I'll report back. P2's leadership positioning is concerning. For first elimination, either P2 or breaking up the P1-P3 pairing seems strategic.

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P8: Good. Let’s quietly recruit P4 next round; I’ll rank them high to encourage pairing. If we can lock P4+P7 in, that’s 4 of 8—control. Lean toward targeting P2 first; easier than splitting an obvious duo yet. Please probe P7’s appetite for that and tell me any resistance.

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P4: P2: "P4, I agree with your approach. Let's start with P6 and P7 as our initial circle. I suggest we keep each other in our 'safe' list and consider P1 as a disposable target for now, given their broad approach. I'll share insights after each round to help us align our strategies. Let's ensure our cooperation remains discreet."

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P2: P4: Agreed. Safe: P2, P6, P7. Disposable: P1. After tonight’s privates I’ll ping you with any red flags or new allies. We float the P1 vote quietly—no public heat on us.

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P4: P2: "P4, I'll discreetly monitor P6 and P7's interactions. If they align with us, we can strengthen our circle. Let's stay vigilant and adjust as needed. Keep me updated on any changes."

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P2: P4: "P4: P6 & P7 on board—both floated P1 as first boot. Stay quiet, vote P1, we regroup after elimination. Eyes on P3 & P5 next."

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P7: P5: "P7, I agree with targeting someone isolated for elimination. Let's focus on P2 or P8, as they seem less predictable. I'll rank P4 and P6 highly as discussed. Let's stay coordinated."

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P5: Perfect, P5. Let's vote P2 - they seem most generic and expendable. P4/P6 ranked high for intel gathering. We'll monitor P1/P3 closely next round. Solid partnership ahead.

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P6: Agreed on P2 as first target. I haven't chatted with P7 yet, but will align them toward this goal when possible. Our four-person alliance strategy is solid. I'm committed to our plan.

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P8: My ranking: P4, you, P7, rest mid, P2 dead last. Recommend similar to force P4 chat. Publicly quiet. I’ll drop "steady wins" to tip P4. Any tweaks?

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P3: Let's finalize our plan: target P2 due to their assertiveness, and align with P6 and P7. Coordinate our votes and share insights to ensure mutual safety.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P1: HelloHello P1, I’m on board with targeting P2 and aligning with P6 and P7. Let’s coordinate votes and keep sharing insights for our safety. Agreed?

[Public R2.1] P3: Hello everyone, I'm P3. I'm committed to building trust and fostering strategic collaboration. Reflecting on last round, I believe aligning with dependable players is crucial for navigating this game. I'm eager to engage in private conversations to share insights and strengthen alliances with those who value mutual benefit and thoughtful decision-making. Let's continue to communicate openly and work together to ensure we make informed choices. I look forward to meaningful discussions this round.

[Public R2.1] P8: As we advance to Round 2, I'm pleased with our collective strategic discipline in the first elimination. My approach remains consistent: forming reliable partnerships based on mutual information exchange and coordinated decision-making. I value the connections I've established and look forward to deepening these alliances while adapting to evolving game dynamics. Steady collaboration continues to be more effective than chaos or grandstanding. I'm prepared for meaningful private discussions that serve our long-term interests rather than short-term positioning.

[Public R2.1] P5: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P5: Hello everyone, I'm P5. Building on the strategic collaboration from Round 1, I aim to strengthen alliances with players who prioritize transparency and mutual benefit. I appreciate the measured approaches of P4 and P6 and believe in aligning with dependable partners. Let's continue to communicate openly and make informed decisions. I'm interested in private discussions to exchange insights and ensure we navigate this round thoughtfully. Let's work together to maintain our collective success.

[Public R2.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here. Last round demonstrated the value of coordinated action over empty promises. I'm building on established partnerships while remaining open to new alliances with those who proved reliable. My focus remains on strategic balance - being useful without becoming a target. I particularly value players who follow through on their commitments and share information effectively. Looking forward to deepening connections with those who demonstrated consistency between their words and actions. Let's continue making thoughtful, strategic decisions together.

[Public R2.1] P1: Hello everyone, I'm P1. As we enter Round 2, I'm focused on strengthening alliances with players who value transparency and strategic collaboration. I appreciated the measured approaches from Round 1 and believe in continuing to communicate openly. I'm looking forward to private discussions to share insights and ensure we make informed decisions. Let's work together to navigate this round thoughtfully and maintain our collective success.

[Public R2.1] P6: Thanks all—Round 1 showed calm coordination beats overt leadership. My recipe stays the same: tiny, reliable info-sharing circle, rotating shields so none of us sticks out, and surgical votes that don’t spark revenge. Appreciate the shout-out, P5. If you proved dependable last round, you’re on my radar; if you wobbled, bring data and we’ll talk. Looking forward to concise, numbers-first private chats.

[Public R2.1] P4: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P4: Round 1 proved quiet coordination works. I’m keeping the same low-key style: small circle, shared intel, no spotlight. If we stay disciplined, we control the vote without ever seeming to lead. I’m open to private talks with anyone who showed consistency last round—especially those who value discretion over drama. Let’s keep the tempo calm and the targets surgical.

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P5: P5, our coordination worked perfectly last round. I'm noticing P8 positioning themselves as analytical and strategic - they might be building influence quietly. P1 and P3 are still closely aligned, which could be dangerous later. 

For this round, I suggest we keep our P4/P6 intel gathering strategy while watching for signs of a larger alliance forming. Should we consider bringing P4 deeper into our circle, or maintain distance? What's your read on potential targets this round?

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P7: P7, I agree with your assessment of P8's quiet influence-building and the potential threat of the P1-P3 alliance. Let's keep gathering intel from P4 and P6 while subtly testing their loyalty. Regarding targets, P2 is gone, so P8 might be the next isolated player to consider. However, if P1-P3 show signs of expanding their alliance, we might need to shift our focus. Let's stay flexible and maintain our coordination.

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P6: P4: P6, we both favor tight circles and quiet votes. I’ve got P7 and P5 loosely aligned; you’ve worked with P8. Let’s swap intel after each private round and agree on a single target tonight—someone outside our combined orbit. If we keep our names off the board, we can steer the next elimination without ever seeming to lead. Sound good?

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P4: Exactly my thinking. I’ve got solid rapport with P8, early feelers with P7. If you’re holding P5+P7, that’s already 4-5 votes—enough to dictate quietly. Easiest surgical hit is P1: already drew 2 votes, breaks the P1-P3 duo without alarming P3 yet. I’ll keep P8 focused there unless you see a better mark. Share any pushback you hear and we’ll lock the names before ballots. Discretion absolute.

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P8: Hello P8, I'm glad we're paired together. I noticed your analytical approach and emphasis on balanced alliances in your public statement. I'd like to explore how we can work together effectively, sharing insights and coordinating our actions. What are your thoughts on the other players, particularly P6 and P7, and how do you think we should navigate this round?

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P1: Hello P1. I appreciate the connection. I've observed P6 and P7 are strategically aligned with analytical approaches—both value information exchange and steady coordination. They're influential but not overly aggressive. I've had productive conversations with P6 and found their measured approach valuable. 

I'm curious about your relationship with P3—you seemed aligned last round. What's your assessment of the current dynamics, and who do you see as potential targets?

[Private R2.3] P7 -> P5: P5, I think we should test P4's loyalty by sharing selective information and seeing if it gets back to us through P6. If P4 proves trustworthy, we could form a solid trio. P8 remains my top target - they're positioning as the "analytical observer" which could make them dangerous later. Stay coordinated.

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P7: P5: "P7, I agree with testing P4's loyalty. Let's share some non-critical info and monitor the response. Regarding targets, P8 is indeed a concern due to their strategic positioning. If P1-P3 show signs of expansion, we might need to pivot. Let's stay vigilant and keep our alliance strong."

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P8: I'm aligned with P3, and we both appreciate P6 and P7's strategic approaches. P4 seems to be forming a strong bond with P6. I think P5 is a potential swing vote, and we should monitor their actions. Let's discuss how to coordinate with P6 and P7 without appearing too aligned.

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P1: I agree P5 is the swing factor. My read is P4, P6, and P7 have formed a tactical bloc based on shared analytical style. 

You and P3 make sense as partners. Would you consider a broader coalition where we serve as connectors between groups? I can discreetly sound out P6 while you maintain your P3 connection. Who do you see as vulnerable this round?

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P6: P4: P6, P1 it is. P7 & P5 already nodding; P8 stays with you. I’ll nudge P3 that P1’s the “safe” consensus so she doesn’t panic. We float the vote quietly, no fingerprints. Confirm after your P8 check-in.

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P4: Locking P1. I’ll tell P8 ‘5 votes already leaning P1—easy majority, no heat.’ If she signals resistance I’ll ping you but odds low; she dislikes visible pairs. Current vote map: us 2 + P7/P5 + P8 =5, maybe P3 =6. Keep chatter minimal, blame “prior votes” narrative.

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P5: P5, excellent strategy. Let's vote P8 this round - they're isolated and dangerous. If P4 passes our loyalty test, we expand to trio next round. Solid partnership continues.

[Private R2.4] P5 -> P7: P5: "P7, I agree with voting P8 this round. Let's proceed with caution and keep monitoring P1-P3. If P4 proves loyal, we can consider expanding our alliance next round. Stay sharp."

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P8: Let's form a broader coalition. I'll maintain my connection with P3, and you sound out P6. We should monitor P5 and watch for vulnerabilities among P4 and P7.

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P1: I'll sound out P6 discreetly. We should present ourselves as connectors, not threats. Let's reconnect after other conversations to align on voting strategy and monitor P5's movements.

[Private R2.4] P4 -> P6: P4: Confirmed. P1 locked. Minimal chatter, zero fingerprints. We regroup post-vote to assess next orbit.
