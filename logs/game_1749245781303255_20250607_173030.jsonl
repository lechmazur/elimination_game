Unlike P4, who cut their closest ally P3 for pure tactics, I’ve balanced loyalty with smart gameplay. And while P2’s consistency is admirable, I’ve shown independent growth throughout. Eliminating me risks rewarding betrayal (P4) over integrity or sidelining a proven collaborator for a strategist (P2). I’ve earned the final 2 through authentic, adaptive play. Choose the player who combines heart and mind for victory. Thank you.\n\n**(89 words)**\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- **Highlights adaptability and trust** to reinforce my core values and appeal to jury members who value integrity (e.g., P7, P8).  \n- **Contrasts with P4** by framing their elimination of P3 as betrayal, potentially swaying P3 and others.  \n- **Acknowledges P2’s strength** but emphasizes my independent growth to differentiate myself.  \n- **Positions me as a balanced choice**—combining strategy and authenticity—to appeal broadly to the jury for the final 2 spot.", "timestamp": "2025-06-07 17:58:20"}
