I've built genuine connections with many of you, always keeping my word and being transparent about my reasoning during eliminations.\n\nI've survived by adapting my strategy and forming meaningful alliances, not by manipulating or deceiving. When I had to vote someone out, I did so based on game dynamics, not personal vendettas.\n\nI hope you'll judge me on how I played with integrity while still making the strategic moves necessary to reach this final position.", "timestamp": "2025-04-09 01:38:15"}
