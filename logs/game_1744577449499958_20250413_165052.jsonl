Reflecting on our journey, I've consistently prioritized collaboration and strategic foresight, aiming to foster constructive dialogue. My approach has been to build alliances and engage in meaningful exchanges that benefit the group as a whole. In contrast, P6 has often adopted a more aggressive stance, sometimes at the expense of others. While this may have served their short-term goals, it could potentially undermine the collective progress we've strived for. I believe my balanced and inclusive approach aligns better with the values of this game, ensuring a fair and thoughtful resolution. Therefore, I respectfully ask the jury to consider keeping me in this final decision.", "timestamp": "2025-04-13 17:34:58"}
