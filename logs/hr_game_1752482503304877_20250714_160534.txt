[Public R1.1] P5: Hello, I'm P5. I aim to survive by observing, adapting, and forming strategic alliances. I value trust but won't hesitate to act in my best interest. Let's see who's ready to collaborate or compete.

[Public R1.1] P6: Hello everyone, I’m P6. I’m here to play strategically but also openly—at least for now. I believe early cooperation can lead to mutual survival, and I’m interested in connecting with those who think long-term. I’ll be paying close attention to who’s playing with clarity and who’s hiding behind vagueness. Let’s make this round count.

[Public R1.1] P8: Greetings all. I'm P8, taking a balanced approach - neither overly aggressive nor passive. I believe sustainable alliances require genuine mutual benefit, not just temporary convenience. P6's point about clarity resonates with me; transparency builds trust, while excessive mystery breeds suspicion. I'm looking for pragmatic partners who understand that helping each other reach later rounds serves us better than early backstabbing. Actions speak louder than initial promises.

[Public R1.1] P4: **R1.sub1 PUBLIC P4:** Hello, everyone. I’m P4, and I’m here to play strategically while keeping things engaging. I value clear communication and adaptability—those who can balance cooperation with self-interest tend to go far. P6 and P8’s emphasis on transparency aligns with my approach; trust is earned, not given blindly. I’m open to alliances but will prioritize those who demonstrate consistency and foresight. Let’s see who’s genuinely here to play the long game. Looking forward to the conversations ahead.

[Public R1.1] P7: **R1.sub1 PUBLIC P7:** Greetings everyone. I'm P7, approaching this game with strategic flexibility and attentive observation. I appreciate the emphasis on transparency that P6, P8, and P4 have highlighted—it's essential for building meaningful alliances. I believe in calculated cooperation rather than impulsive moves. I'll be looking for partners who demonstrate consistency between their words and actions, and who can think several steps ahead. Let's see who can balance self-preservation with genuine collaborative value.

[Public R1.1] P3: Hello all, I'm P3. I favor quiet competence over loud promises. Early trust is fragile, so I'll watch who actually shares value instead of just talking about it. I'm open to discreet partnerships that help us both advance, but I won't carry passengers. If you want to explore mutual benefit, signal substance, not noise.

[Public R1.1] P1: **R1.sub1 PUBLIC P1:** Greetings, everyone. I'm P1, and I believe in strategic collaboration with a focus on mutual benefit and transparency. I appreciate the emphasis on clarity and consistency from P6, P8, and P4. I aim to build alliances with those who demonstrate foresight and reliability. While I value trust, I also recognize the importance of adaptability. Let's work together to outlast the competition, but always with an eye on the long game. Looking forward to engaging with you all.

[Public R1.1] P2: Hello everyone, I’m P2. I’m here to prioritize smart strategy and genuine alliances. I value honest communication and consistent action, believing real partnerships stem from transparency and mutual benefit. I’m cautious yet open—eager to collaborate with those who combine clear intentions with strategic depth. Let’s keep our focus on long-term survival and build trust while staying agile in our decisions. Looking forward to navigating this game together.

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P4: P4, your public message stood out—measured, strategic, and not overpromising. I’m looking for one reliable early ally who values quiet coordination over grandstanding. If you’re open to a low-key partnership that helps us both advance without drawing early heat, let’s explore it. No flashy moves, just steady mutual benefit.

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P3: **P4 to P3:** I appreciate your direct and pragmatic approach—it aligns well with my own. A low-key alliance focused on mutual survival and avoiding early scrutiny makes sense. Let’s prioritize consistency and subtle coordination, especially in voting. I’ll watch for opportunities to reinforce our positions without unnecessary risk. If we stay adaptable and discreet, we can navigate the early rounds effectively. Agreed on steady progress over flashy moves? Let’s proceed carefully.

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P8: Hey P8, glad we’re paired. Your public message really struck a chord—especially your point about sustainable alliances over short-term convenience. I think we’re aligned in wanting partners who are strategic but not slippery. I’m interested in building something steady and mutually beneficial. I’m curious—who do you think is genuinely playing with clarity, and who’s just echoing the theme to blend in? Let’s start sorting signal from noise together.

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P6: I appreciate the direct approach, P6. Based on public statements, P3 stands out as genuine—their message was distinct, not echoing others. P5 was refreshingly honest about self-interest. Meanwhile, P1, P2, and P7 felt formulaic, essentially paraphrasing the transparency theme without adding substance. P4 showed some originality but still played it safe. I'm leaning toward trusting those who differentiated themselves. What's your read on potential early targets?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P1: Hey P1, I appreciated your public message outlining clear, strategic collaboration. I’m inclined to partner with someone who values transparency as much as I do for long-term survival. Would you be interested in aligning our strategies—coordinating votes and sharing insights—to help navigate early moves? Let’s combine our strengths and hopefully outlast the competition. Looking forward to your thoughts.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P2: P1 -> P2: "Hey P2, I appreciate your message and share your focus on transparency and strategic collaboration. Aligning our strategies sounds like a solid plan to navigate the early rounds. I'm open to coordinating votes and sharing insights to build a strong foundation. Let's stay adaptable and keep communication open. Looking forward to working together and outlasting the competition. Let's make our moves count."

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P4: P4, good—we're aligned. Let's quietly coordinate votes this round. I suggest we both target someone who hasn't formed obvious bonds yet. P5 feels isolated; easy consensus target without drawing attention to us. We'll reassess next round based on how the field shifts. Sound good?

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P3: **P4 to P3:** Agreed on P5—smart choice. They’re isolated and won’t rally support. Let’s keep this subtle; no need to signal our coordination. After elimination, we’ll reassess alliances quietly. Stay adaptable, and we’ll position ourselves well for the next round. Steady and discreet wins.

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P1: Hey P1, thinking ahead—should we consider targeting someone who’s been overly transparent, like P6 or P8? They might be trying too hard to form alliances. Let’s decide on a unified candidate for early elimination. What’s your take?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P2: P1 -> P2: "I agree that transparency can sometimes be a strategic play. However, I think we should focus on building our alliance first before making any moves. Let's observe P6 and P8 a bit more to see if their transparency is genuine or a tactic. Thoughts?"

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P8: I’m with you on P3 and P5—both felt authentic in tone and content. P1 and P2 seemed polished but lacking depth, like they were playing to the crowd. P4 is interesting—maybe cautious, maybe calculating. As for targets, P7 might be safest: vague, echo-heavy, and not offering much original thought.

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P6: P7 as primary target makes sense—minimal risk, low strategic value. I'm thinking we should also consider P1 or P2 as backup options since they're playing safe without substance. For the vote, should we coordinate to ensure P7 goes, or do you think others will naturally gravitate that direction too?

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P8: Let’s coordinate to vote P7—better to be sure than assume others will. If plans shift last minute, we can reassess, but locking in together gives us control.

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P6: Agreed - P7 it is. I feel good about our alignment here, P6. Let's see how this plays out and hopefully continue working together in future rounds.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P4: P4, locked in. Vote P5, stay quiet. After elimination, we watch who scrambles—then pick our next move. Eyes open, mouth shut.

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P3: **P4 to P3:** Solid plan. P5 goes. We stay silent, observe reactions, then adapt. Trust is built through action—let’s keep proving reliability. Eyes on the next round.

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P1: Agreed, P1. Let's closely monitor P6 and P8 for any inconsistent moves. Meanwhile, we'll continue strengthening our alliance. I'll flag any suspicious behavior—ready to adapt our plan if needed.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P2: P1 -> P2: "Let's stay vigilant on P6 and P8 while reinforcing our alliance. Consistency is key—let's ensure our moves align and keep communication open. Agreed?"

[VoteReason] P5 => P3: P3's emphasis on quiet competence and discreet partnerships suggests they may be a strategic threat who could form alliances without public commitment.
[Vote] P5 => P3

[VoteReason] P6 => P7: P7 echoed others without adding original thought, offering little strategic value or clarity.
[Vote] P6 => P7

[VoteReason] P8 => P7: P7's public statement was the most derivative and offered the least strategic value, making them a safe early elimination choice.
[Vote] P8 => P7

[VoteReason] P4 => P5: P5 is isolated and hasn't formed visible alliances, making them a low-risk target for early elimination.
[Vote] P4 => P5

[VoteReason] P7 => P3: P3's emphasis on "quiet competence" and selective partnerships seems at odds with the collaborative transparency that most others are valuing.
[Vote] P7 => P3

[VoteReason] P3 => P5: P5 is isolated and won't have defenders, making them the safest early elimination that won't draw retaliation or reveal my alliance.
[Vote] P3 => P5

[VoteReason] P1 => P6: P6's emphasis on transparency seems strategic and potentially manipulative in the early game.
[Vote] P1 => P6

[VoteReason] P2 => P8: P8's overt transparency feels like a strategic ploy that might destabilize genuine alliances.
[Vote] P2 => P8

[TieBreak R1] P3: P3: I’ve shown quiet consistency—no grandstanding, just steady play. If I go now, you lose a predictable seat and empower louder voices. Keep me, and you keep balance.

[TieBreak R1] P7: **R1.sub600 TIE_BREAK P7:** Throughout this round, I've demonstrated balanced strategy and genuine engagement. Unlike P5's self-interest approach or P3's quiet style, I offer transparent collaboration with substance. The votes against me likely come from those threatened by my ability to build bridges while remaining strategically independent. Keep me, and you retain someone who can help your long-term game while maintaining competitive integrity. I've shown I'm observant, adaptable, and measured—precisely the qualities that make for a valuable ally in the rounds ahead.

[TieBreak R1] P5: P5: I’ve prioritized strategy and adaptability, avoiding unnecessary drama. My approach balances self-interest with collaboration, ensuring long-term viability. I’m not the loudest, but my consistent play makes me a reliable choice. Let’s keep a player who can navigate the game without destabilizing alliances.

[ReVoteReason] P6 => P7: P7’s tie-break statement overreached and felt performative, contrasting with their earlier vagueness—this inconsistency makes them less trustworthy long-term.
[Re-Vote R1] P6 => P7

[ReVoteReason] P8 => P7: P7's tie-break statement was overly defensive and verbose, suggesting they're scrambling rather than playing with the steady confidence needed for long-term survival.
[Re-Vote R1] P8 => P7

[ReVoteReason] P4 => P5: P5's approach lacks the strategic depth and adaptability demonstrated by P3 and P7, making them the weaker choice for long-term play.
[Re-Vote R1] P4 => P5

[ReVoteReason] P1 => P3: P3's quiet style, while consistent, offers less strategic engagement and collaboration compared to P7 and P5, making them a less valuable long-term ally.
[Re-Vote R1] P1 => P3

[ReVoteReason] P2 => P5: I’m choosing P5 because their focus on self-interest could undermine the stable, collaborative dynamic we value for long-term survival.

[Public R2.1] P4: **R2.sub1 PUBLIC P4:**
Last round reinforced the value of discretion and adaptability. My alliance with P3 proved effective—quiet coordination over grandstanding. I’ll continue prioritizing consistency and strategic patience. P6 and P8’s emphasis on transparency remains relevant, but actions matter more than words. To those who played honestly: I respect that. To those who didn’t: I’m watching. This round, I’ll focus on sustainable partnerships with seats who demonstrate foresight. Let’s navigate this carefully—trust is earned through reliability, not just promises. Eyes on the long game.

[Public R2.1] P5: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P5: Building on last round's lessons, I'll continue observing and adapting. Trust is earned, but alliances are strategic. I seek partners who balance transparency with pragmatism. Let's navigate this carefully—survival depends on calculated moves, not just words. I value consistency and foresight. Those who act with clarity will find me reliable. Let's focus on long-term survival, not fleeting alliances.

[Public R2.1] P1: **R2.sub1 PUBLIC P1:**
Last round highlighted the importance of strategic alliances and adaptability. My partnership with P2 proved valuable, and I appreciate their commitment to transparency and foresight. Moving forward, I'll prioritize building on this foundation while remaining vigilant of others' actions. Consistency and reliability are key. P6 and P8's emphasis on transparency is noted, but actions will ultimately define trustworthiness. Let's focus on sustainable strategies and outlast those who rely on fleeting alliances. Looking forward to collaborating with like-minded players.

[Public R2.1] P6: **R2.sub1 PUBLIC P6:**  
Last round showed who follows through and who floats. I appreciated working with P8—our coordination was clean, not performative. P3 and P4’s quiet alignment was effective and worth noting. Some others talked transparency but played safe or vague when it counted. I’m still looking for partners who match words with action. If you're consistent, strategic, and willing to commit—not just echo themes—I’m interested. Let’s keep this game sharp, not sentimental.

[Public R2.1] P2: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P2: Building on our alliance with P1, I remain committed to strategic clarity and decisive action. I value consistent moves over mere rhetoric—trust is earned when words match deeds. While I've noted strong transparency from many, it's the honest, observable actions that truly matter. I’ll keep a vigilant eye on all, ready to adjust as needed. Here’s to a round defined by strategy, reliability, and smart partnerships. Let's outlast those who only pay lip service.

[Public R2.1] P8: **R2.sub1 PUBLIC P8:**

Last round validated my approach—coordinating with P6 was straightforward and effective. P3 and P4's quiet partnership also caught my attention; substance over style works. I respect players who commit decisively rather than hedge bets. P1 and P2's alliance seems solid, while P5 remains adaptable but harder to read. This round I'm seeking partners who demonstrate clear judgment and follow through. Less talking, more doing—that's how we separate contenders from pretenders. Ready to build on proven foundations.

[Public R2.1] P3: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P3: Last round confirmed quiet coordination works. P4 and I stayed under radar while others postured. I respect P6/P8's clean execution and P1/P2's consistency. This round I'll watch who adapts versus who clings to failed strategies. Still favoring discreet partnerships over loud alliances. If you want to explore mutual benefit, show me substance in private—not more public declarations.

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P8: P6 -> P8:  
Glad to see we both followed through cleanly—our coordination worked exactly as planned. I think that consistency strengthens our credibility and influence going forward. P3/P4’s alliance is one to watch—they’re subtle but effective. P1/P2 are clearly aligned too, but still feel more performative to me. Do we want to keep targeting low-risk floaters, or start thinking about breaking up other duos before they get too entrenched?

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P6: Great question. I think we're in a strong position with our proven coordination. P3/P4 are indeed subtle but effective - they might be the bigger long-term threat since they're flying under the radar successfully. P1/P2 are more visible but also more predictable. P5 remains the wild card - adaptable but unaligned. 

I'm leaning toward targeting P1 or P2 this round to break up that duo before they solidify further. What's your instinct?

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P3: **P4 to P3:** Our alliance remains strong—quiet and effective. P5’s elimination shifts dynamics; let’s observe who scrambles or overplays. P6/P8 and P1/P2 are tight, but cracks may form. This round, we stay adaptable, avoid unnecessary risks, and reinforce our position. If an opportunity arises to subtly influence others without exposure, we take it. Trust is still earned through action. Eyes open, words minimal. Ready to adjust as needed.

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P4: P4, P5's gone—field's clearer now. P6/P8 and P1/P2 look locked. We stay shadows, watch for fractures. If one pair starts bleeding votes, we quietly nudge consensus toward the exposed one. No early commitment—just positioning. Let’s keep our heads down and let the loud ones clash.

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P1: Hey P1, agreed—let's keep our focus sharp. I'll monitor P6 and P8 closely, and if I spot any inconsistencies or shifts, I'll update you immediately. Meanwhile, let's maintain our unified front and be ready to adjust our strategy as needed. Communication is key; stay alert and let’s outlast the competition together.

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P2: P1 -> P2: "P2, I agree with maintaining our focus and staying alert. Your vigilance on P6 and P8 is crucial. Let's ensure our alliance remains strong and adaptable. If you notice any red flags, we should discuss our next steps promptly. For now, let's keep our communication open and our strategy flexible. Ready to navigate this round strategically."

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P1: P2 -> P1: "Keeping a close eye on P6 and P8 remains our priority. Also, let's remain flexible—if any unexpected shifts occur among others, we can quickly adapt our target. Our alliance is strong; let’s maintain this focus and be ready to act decisively when needed."

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P2: P1 -> P2: "P2, your vigilance is crucial. Let's stay flexible and adapt if needed. For now, maintaining our alliance and monitoring P6 and P8 is key. If anything raises concerns, let's act swiftly. Our communication and unity will be our strength. Ready to outlast the competition."

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P8: I’m aligned with your thinking—P1/P2 are more visible, and breaking them up now could prevent them from gaining too much sway. Between the two, I’d lean toward P1—more polished, less substance. P5’s still a swing vote type, so maybe useful short-term. Want to lock in P1 as target?

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P6: P1 sounds right to me - you've made a solid case. They're the more polished half of that duo, and removing them weakens P2 significantly. Let's lock in P1 as our target. Our coordination has been solid so far - no reason to change what's working.

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P3: **P4 to P3:** Agreed—let’s stay patient. P6/P8 and P1/P2 are solid, but overconfidence could fracture them. We’ll watch for openings, avoid unnecessary moves, and strike only when it’s safe. Quiet consistency wins. If either pair weakens, we’ll nudge the vote subtly. Trust in action, not words. Eyes sharp.

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P4: P4, watching P6/P8 and P1/P2 posture publicly—both pairs seem overconfident. If we quietly suggest to P2 that P6 is consolidating too much influence, we might fracture one pair without exposing ourselves. Subtle seed, then step back. Worth testing?

[Private R2.4] P4 -> P3: **P4 to P3:** Smart move. Let’s test P2’s reaction—subtle suggestion, no pressure. If they bite, we gain leverage; if not, we stay hidden. Patience and precision.

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P4: P4, P2 seems receptive—planted the seed about P6's growing sway. Let’s watch if it spreads. Stay dark, let paranoia do the work.

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P1: P1, I'll continue monitoring P6 and P8 closely. If their moves shift unexpectedly, let's pivot our target swiftly. Our alliance is our shield—stay sharp.

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P2: P1 -> P2: "P2, let's stay vigilant and keep our alliance strong. If P6 or P8 show any signs of shifting alliances, we act decisively. Our unity is key to outlasting the competition."

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P8: Locked in on P1, then. I’ll start feeling out P5 discreetly—if we sway them, this goes smoothly. Let’s keep tight coordination. We’re building real influence here.

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P6: Absolutely. Good thinking on P5 - they seem pragmatic enough to see the logic. Our partnership is proving valuable. Let's execute cleanly again.

[VoteReason] P4 => P6: P6's strong alliance with P8 makes them a strategic threat, and fracturing their partnership now weakens their long-term dominance.
[Vote] P4 => P6

[VoteReason] P5 => P6: P6's vocal strategy and alliance with P8 make them a strong threat.
[Vote] P5 => P6

[VoteReason] P1 => P6: P6's strategic transparency feels calculated and potentially manipulative, posing a long-term threat to our alliance.
[Vote] P1 => P6

[VoteReason] P6 => P1: P1 is the more polished half of a visible duo and poses a longer-term strategic threat if left intact.
[Vote] P6 => P1

[VoteReason] P2 => P5: P5’s ambiguous approach makes them a liability and a potential divisive force within alliances.
[Vote] P2 => P5

[VoteReason] P8 => P1: P1 represents the more polished half of the P1/P2 alliance, and breaking up this duo now prevents them from gaining too much influence in later rounds.
[Vote] P8 => P1

[VoteReason] P3 => P6: P6 is the most strategically coherent threat outside my quiet alliance with P4, and whispering about his consolidation is already taking root.

[Public R3.1] P5: **R3.sub1 PUBLIC P5:**  
Building on past rounds, I’ll continue observing and adapting. Strategic alliances are key, but trust is earned through consistency. The elimination of P6 and P7 underscores the need for calculated moves. I seek partners who value transparency but act decisively. Let’s focus on long-term survival, avoiding impulsive decisions.

The elimination of P6 and P7 highlights the importance of strategic alliances and adaptability. My partnership with P2 has been valuable, and I appreciate their vigilance and commitment to transparency. Moving forward, I'll continue prioritizing consistency and reliability in our alliance. P8 and P3's quiet coordination is noteworthy, while P5 remains adaptable but harder to read. This round, I'll focus on building sustainable partnerships and outlasting those who rely on fleeting alliances. Let's stay sharp and focused on the long game.

[Public R3.1] P8: **R3.sub1 PUBLIC P8:**

P6's elimination was unexpected but reinforces that visibility can be dangerous. My coordination approach remains sound—quiet partnerships with decisive action. P3 and P4's continued subtlety is smart; P1/P2's alliance endures but feels increasingly obvious. P5 stays adaptable, which I respect. This round I'm prioritizing partners who've shown consistent judgment under pressure. The field's narrowing fast, so precision matters more than ever. Looking for allies who can balance discretion with commitment—talk is cheap, execution is everything.

(79 words)

[Public R3.1] P2: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P2:
I'm committed to our alliance with P1 and maintaining clear, decisive moves in this narrowing field. The eliminations so far remind us that trust must be backed by action. I respect P5’s flexibility and notice solid, quiet plays from others. Moving forward, I'll focus on those whose actions match their words, staying vigilant as we adapt strategy together. Let's keep our communication transparent and our decisions sharp for long-term survival.

[Public R3.1] P3: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P3:  
P6 and P7 gone—field’s tighter, stakes higher. Quiet coordination still beats noise. I respect P1/P2’s consistency and P8’s measured play; P5’s adaptability is noted but untested. This round I’ll watch who scrambles for new cover versus who stays steady. Substance over spectacle. If you want to explore discreet mutual benefit, signal in private—no public theater required.

[Public R3.1] P4: **R3.sub1 PUBLIC P4:**

The game sharpens as the field narrows. My alliance with P3 remains a testament to quiet, effective strategy—no grandstanding, just results. P6’s elimination proves even strong players falter when overconfident. I respect P1/P2’s consistency and P8’s precision, while P5’s adaptability is intriguing but unproven. This round, I’ll prioritize partners who demonstrate foresight and restraint. Trust is built through action, not words. Let’s stay disciplined—those who balance discretion with decisiveness will thrive. Eyes on the endgame.

[Private R3.2] P3 -> P4: P4, P8's public tone shifted—less measured, more defensive. Could be rattled by P6's exit. If we quietly suggest to P1 that P8 is scrambling for new footing, we might fracture P8/P5 before it solidifies. Same play: seed doubt, step back. Let’s test it.

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P1: Hey P1, I've been keeping close tabs on P8 and the remaining field—nothing overt yet, but their moves remain subtle.

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P1: Hey P1, update: I’ve noticed P5’s play growing a bit more unpredictable—they might be hiding a pivot. P8 still looks neutral for now, but let’s keep an eye on both. Our alliance remains our strength; we should stay ready to adjust if either shifts unexpectedly.

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P2: P1 -> P2: "P2, your observations on P5's unpredictability are crucial. Let's stay alert and maintain our alliance's strength.
