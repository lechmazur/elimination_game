My aim was always to foster mutual respect and collaboration, ensuring productive exchanges that benefited not just myself but the group as a whole.\n\nIn contrast, while my opponent has shown strategic acumen, there have been moments where their decisions leaned towards self-interest, potentially undermining group cohesion. I believe my approach aligns more closely with the spirit of collaboration and mutual benefit that this game embodies.\n\nI ask the jury to consider the value of maintaining a collaborative atmosphere and to support the candidate who has consistently worked towards that goal. Thank you for your consideration.", "timestamp": "2025-02-28 05:51:53"}
