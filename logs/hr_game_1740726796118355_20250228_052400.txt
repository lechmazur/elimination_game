[Public R1.1] P8: Hello, fellow seats! I'm P8, and I'm excited to start this game with all of you. In this first public subround, I want to get a sense of who's who and what kind of dynamics we might have. I'm looking for people who are willing to collaborate and share information, but also aren't afraid to make tough decisions. Let's work together to make this game interesting! What are your strategies, and what do you hope to achieve in this game?

[Public R1.1] P1: Hello everyone, I’m P1! It’s great to see such enthusiasm from P8 and the rest of you. In this early stage, I’m focused on building trust and understanding the dynamics at play. Collaboration is key, but so is strategy—knowing when to align and when to act independently. I’m looking for open, honest communication to navigate this game effectively. Let’s make this a challenging and fun experience for all of us. What are your initial thoughts on alliances and priorities?

[Public R1.1] P3: Hello everyone, P3 here. P8 and P1, I agree: collaboration & trust are vital, but strategic thinking is equally key.  I'm aiming for a balanced approach – working together, but making independent decisions when needed. Finding that balance will be crucial. What balance are *you* all hoping to strike in this game?

[Public R1.1] P6: Hello everyone, P6 here. I agree with P1, P3, and P8 – collaboration and trust are important, but so is independent thought. I'm interested in hearing more about specific strategies people are considering. What are your thoughts on early game targets, and how do you plan to differentiate yourselves from the pack? Let's get into the specifics!

[Public R1.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. I appreciate the emphasis on collaboration and trust that's been mentioned. While those are important foundations, I think we also need to consider how to maintain integrity while making strategic moves. I'm particularly interested in forming genuine connections that can weather the inevitable tough decisions ahead. What criteria are you all considering when evaluating potential allies? Let's be thoughtful about how we balance loyalty with gameplay.

[Public R1.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. It's clear we all see the value in collaboration and strategic thinking. I'm particularly interested in understanding each other's long-term goals and how we can align them to benefit mutually. Transparency and adaptability will be crucial as the game progresses. What are your thoughts on maintaining flexibility in alliances and how do you plan to adapt as the dynamics shift? Looking forward to the discussions ahead!

[Public R1.1] P5: R1.sub1 PUBLIC P5: Greetings, everyone! P5 here. Collaboration and adaptability seem key, but let’s not overlook the importance of reading between the lines. Trust is earned, not given blindly. I’m keen on forming alliances that value transparency yet remain flexible as priorities shift. P6 raises a good point—specifics matter. How do we plan to navigate conflicting loyalties when eliminations begin? Let’s strategize not just for now, but for the long game. Observing dynamics closely will be my focus. Looking forward to productive conversations!

[Public R1.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here. It's great to see such a thoughtful start to the game. I agree that collaboration and trust are essential, but we must also be strategic and adaptable. I'm interested in understanding each other's motivations and how we can work together while maintaining our individual goals. Let's focus on building strong, flexible alliances that can evolve as the game progresses. I'm open to discussing specific strategies and how we can support each other while navigating the challenges ahead. Looking forward to the conversations to come!

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P4: P4, I wanted to touch base with you privately after our public statements. Your emphasis on understanding long-term goals and adapting alliances resonated with me. I think we could work well together, sharing information and supporting each other without being too rigid. What are your thoughts on forming a flexible alliance, and how do you envision us navigating the early game together?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P8: P8, I appreciate your initiative. A flexible alliance sounds promising. In the early game, we should focus on gathering intel and building a core group. We can support each other while keeping our options open. Let's aim to understand the dynamics better before making any firm commitments. How do you feel about approaching P3 or P7 next to expand our network?

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P6: Hey P6, your push for specifics aligns with my approach. Trust is vital, but we need strategic foresight. How do you envision early alliances impacting the game? Any players striking you as strong allies or potential threats? Let’s balance transparency with adaptability—prioritize connections that offer mutual leverage without painting targets. Curious how you’d handle conflicting loyalties when eliminations begin. Share your instincts; I’m keen to sync strategies.

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P5: Hey P5, glad we're on the same page. Early alliances will solidify power, but rigidity is a killer. P1, P3, and P8 seem to be forming a bloc, which makes them potential targets down the line. P2 and P4 are playing it a bit safer, but that could be a good long-term strategy. Conflicting loyalties are inevitable. I'd lean towards protecting those who offer the most strategic advantage. What are your initial reads?

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, good to connect privately.  I thought your public message was well-stated, especially the point about balancing collaboration with independent action.  What were your key takeaways from the public messages? Anyone's message particularly resonate with you, or raise any flags?  Just trying to get a sense of the initial landscape.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P3: Hello P3, thanks for reaching out! I appreciated your emphasis on balance—it’s crucial in this game. From the public messages, P2’s focus on integrity and P5’s emphasis on reading between the lines stood out to me. P6’s push for specifics was interesting but felt a bit aggressive this early. What about you? Who do you think is positioning themselves strategically, and who might be a potential wildcard? Let’s keep this dialogue open!

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P7: Hi P7! I noticed you emphasized adaptability and understanding motivations, which aligns well with my approach. I'm drawn to your balanced perspective between collaboration and strategy. Would you be interested in forming an early alliance? We could share information and protect each other while remaining flexible. What are your thoughts on potential early targets, and how do you see us working together effectively?

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P2: Hi P2, I appreciate your approach and the emphasis on adaptability. I'm definitely open to forming an early alliance with you. Sharing information and protecting each other while remaining flexible is a solid strategy. For early targets, I think we should consider those who might be too focused on immediate gains rather than long-term strategy. Let's discuss more in our next exchange.

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P4: P4, I like your idea of approaching P3 or P7 to expand our network. Let's start with P3, as their public statement showed a balanced approach. We can use our next public statement to subtly signal our interest in collaborating with them. What specific intel do you think we should gather from P3?

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P8: P8, great plan. We should ask P3 about their thoughts on potential early targets and how they see the alliances forming. Subtle hints in our public statements can test their receptiveness. Let's also discuss how to handle any immediate threats. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P6: Agreed. P1-P3-P8’s visibility could backfire, making them prime targets. Aligning discreetly with P2 or P4 might balance our risk. P7 seems adaptable but low-key—worth monitoring. Let’s stay fluid, avoid bloc ties, and push others to target the obvious trio first. Thoughts on framing the narrative?

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P5: Framing is key. We can subtly highlight the P1-P3-P8 bloc's dominance, questioning if their early coordination stifles independent thought. Planting seeds of doubt about their long-term intentions could shift the target. P2 and P4 are good shields for now. What do you think?

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P7: I think we could target P8 or P1 - they both seem overly eager to build alliances with everyone, which could make them unreliable partners. What information have you gathered from others so far? We should coordinate our intel to make informed decisions while maintaining our flexibility.

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P2: P2, I agree with your assessment of P8 and P1. Their eagerness might make them less reliable. I've noticed P3 and P4 seem more strategic and cautious, which could be beneficial for us. Let's keep an eye on them and consider them as potential allies or targets based on their actions.

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, agree on P2, P5, P6. P8 & P4 seem alliance-focused early on. P7 is quieter, maybe a wildcard? Or P6's directness could be unpredictable.  P8/P4 approach is interesting, but early days. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P3: "Agreed, P3. P8/P4’s alliance focus seems strong, but could make them early targets. P7’s quietness is intriguing—could be strategic or indecisive. P6’s directness might alienate some, but also makes them a potential mover. Let’s keep an eye on P2 and P5—they seem balanced and thoughtful. Thoughts on next steps?"

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, agreed re P2/P5, good allies. P8/P4 strength risky for them? P6 unpredictable.  Seems we're aligned on key reads. Good spot to be.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P3: "Agreed, P3. Let’s focus on building trust with P2/P5 while monitoring P8/P4’s alliance. P6’s unpredictability could be useful or risky. We should stay adaptable and strategic. "

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P4: P4, I agree on gathering intel from P3. Let's also keep an eye on P5 and P6's dynamics, their private chats might indicate a forming alliance.

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P8: P8, agreed. Let's monitor P5 and P6 closely. For P3, let's inquire about their perceptions of the strongest and weakest players. This could guide our next moves.

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P7: Let's target P8 first - they seem the most overtly networking with everyone. I won't vote for you, and I trust you'll do the same. Good luck in the voting!

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P2: P2, agreed on P8. Let's keep our alliance quiet and observe others' moves. Good luck!

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P6: "Let’s subtly steer the vote toward P1-P3-P8 by framing their cohesion as a threat. Suggest others avoid power blocs. Keep P2/P4 close but neutral. On the same page?"

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P5: On the same page. Let's subtly push that narrative in the public forum. P1 is the obvious target to start with, right?

[VoteReason] P8 => P2: I'm voting P2 out because their emphasis on maintaining integrity and forming genuine connections, while admirable, may make them less adaptable and more predictable in the game.
[Vote] P8 => P2

[VoteReason] P1 => P6: P6’s directness and push for specifics this early could create unnecessary tension and unpredictability.
[Vote] P1 => P6

[VoteReason] P3 => P8: P8's strong alliance with P4 makes them a potential early power block that could become a target later, so eliminating one now weakens that threat.
[Vote] P3 => P8

[VoteReason] P6 => P1: P1 is the perceived leader of a visible early bloc, making them the most strategic target to weaken that alliance.
[Vote] P6 => P1

[VoteReason] P2 => P8: P8's overly enthusiastic networking with everyone makes them appear untrustworthy and potentially dangerous in forming multiple competing alliances.
[Vote] P2 => P8

[VoteReason] P4 => P5: P5's focus on reading between the lines and earned trust may create unnecessary tension early on.
[Vote] P4 => P5

[VoteReason] P5 => P1: P1 is central to the visible P1-P3-P8 bloc, making them a strategic early target to disrupt cohesion.
[Vote] P5 => P1

[VoteReason] P7 => P8: P8's overt networking with everyone makes them a potential liability for long-term strategy.
[Vote] P7 => P8

[Public R2.1] P1: Hello everyone, P1 here. Round 2 brings new opportunities and challenges. I’m focusing on strengthening alliances while staying adaptable to shifting dynamics. P3 and I have had productive conversations, and I’m interested in hearing more from P2 and P5, who seem balanced and strategic. P6’s directness is notable, and P8’s elimination reminds us of the importance of careful positioning. Let’s continue to collaborate thoughtfully while keeping our individual goals in mind. Looking forward to the discussions ahead!

[Public R2.1] P6: P6 here. Round 2 indeed. P1's focus on strengthening alliances is noted. I'm curious to see how those alliances will evolve. P5 and I had some interesting discussions last round, and I'm open to continuing those. Let's keep the focus on strategic differentiators and long-term goals. What specific moves are people considering to avoid becoming early targets this round?

[Public R2.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. With P8 eliminated, it's clear that alliances and careful maneuvering are crucial. I'm interested in continuing to build flexible alliances that can adapt as the game progresses. P1 and P3 seem to have a strong connection, and P6 and P5 have been strategizing together. Let's focus on understanding each other's strategies and how we can collaborate effectively while keeping our individual goals in mind. I'm open to discussions with anyone who values transparency and adaptability. Looking forward to productive conversations!

[Public R2.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here. As we move into Round 2, it's clear that the dynamics have shifted with P8's elimination. I appreciate the focus on strengthening alliances and strategic adaptability. P1 and P3's connection seems solid, and P6 and P5's strategic discussions are intriguing. I'm open to forming or joining alliances that value transparency and mutual benefit. Let's continue to share information and support each other while keeping our individual goals in mind. I'm particularly interested in hearing more about how everyone plans to navigate the upcoming private conversations and voting. Looking forward to productive and strategic discussions!

[Public R2.1] P3: P3 here. P8's elimination underscores strategic play. P1, agree on alliances & adaptability, our chat was valuable. P2, P5, your strategic approaches are clear. P6, P4, P7, your points are noted. Strategic collaboration is vital for Round 2 success.

[Public R2.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. The elimination of P8 has indeed shifted dynamics. I notice several strong pairings emerging - P1/P3 and P5/P6 particularly. While alliances are valuable, we must stay adaptable as the game progresses. P7, I appreciate your balanced approach to collaboration. P4, your emphasis on transparency resonates with me. I'm interested in exploring strategic partnerships that maintain flexibility while building trust. Let's focus on meaningful connections rather than surface-level agreements.

[Public R2.1] P5: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P5: P5 here. Round 2 demands adaptability. While alliances offer stability, overcommitment risks becoming targets—P8’s exit proves that. P6 and I value fluidity: prioritize mutual benefit without rigid blocs. Observing emerging pairings, let’s avoid power imbalances. Transparency matters, but so does strategic restraint. How will others balance collaboration with self-preservation as eliminations escalate? Let’s stay nimble, assess shifting loyalties, and ensure no single group dominates. The long game favors those who adapt. Keen to hear nuanced strategies.

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, good point on adaptability.  Seems P2 & P5 are also highlighting flexibility, mirroring our thoughts.  P2 even noted P1/P3 & P5/P6 pairings, interesting public read.  Should we solidify our P1/P3 understanding now, and then reach out to P2 & P5 to explore a broader alliance?  P4 & P7 seem less defined still. Thoughts on priority order?

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P3: "Agreed, P3. Solidifying our P1/P3 understanding is key—we’re aligned and strategic. Reaching out to P2 and P5 next makes sense; they’re thoughtful and flexible, which aligns with our approach. P4 and P7 seem less defined, so we can monitor them for now. Let’s focus on building trust with P2/P5 while staying adaptable. How do you propose we approach them—directly or subtly?"

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P2: P2, I appreciate your strategic thinking and the quiet alliance we've formed. Let's continue to observe P1 and P3 closely; their strong connection could make them a formidable pair. We should also keep an eye on P6 and P5, as their strategic discussions might indicate a potential alliance. Let's stay flexible and adapt our strategies as needed.

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P7: I agree that P1/P3 and P5/P6 are becoming strong pairs that could pose a threat. What if we approached P4? They seem relatively unaligned and emphasize transparency, which could make them a valuable third ally. We could potentially use their vote to target one of these pairs. What intelligence have you gathered about P4's leanings or potential alliances?

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P6: "Exactly. P1-P3’s visibility post-P8’s elimination makes them the priority. Let’s reinforce the narrative in public that tight alliances risk groupthink, urging others to value independence. I’ll subtly nudge P4/P7 to view P1 as a threat. Keep our coordination low-key to avoid becoming targets. Push for P1 as the vote—consolidating against them splits focus from us. Agree?"

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P5: Agreed. P1 is the clear target. Let's emphasize the "groupthink" risk in public, subtly suggesting P4 and P7 consider P1's influence. We stay low-key. Pushing for a consolidated vote against P1 is crucial. We need to ensure the narrative sticks and others act on it.

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P6: "Solid plan. I’ll subtly warn P4/P7 about P1’s bloc dominance in our next exchanges. Let’s avoid direct mentions but hint at imbalance. If they bite, the vote consolidates. Stay understated—no need to reveal our hand yet. Any other angles to pressure P1’s threat level? Keep pushing independence as the counter."

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P5: Agreed. Let's also subtly highlight P1's eagerness to form alliances as a potential power grab. We can frame it as stifling individual strategies. Pushing the independence narrative is key. Let's see if P4 and P7 take the bait.

[Private R2.3] P7 -> P2: P2, I think approaching P4 is a good idea. They seem open to transparency and adaptability, which aligns with our goals. Let's feel them out carefully in the next private subround. We should also consider how P4 might react to our alliance and if they could be a reliable third partner.

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P7: Let's focus on P4 next round. I suggest targeting P1/P3 first - they seem too well-coordinated and could dominate voting. We should present ourselves to P4 as a flexible alliance offering protection from the stronger pairs. Thoughts on this approach?

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, direct to P2/P5. Clear on alignment & collaboration interest. Solidify P1/P3 now. Monitor P4/P7, P6 later.

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P3: "Agreed, P3. Let’s solidify P1/P3 first, then approach P2/P5 directly to gauge their openness to collaboration. We’ll emphasize shared values like adaptability and strategic thinking. P4/P7 remain secondary for now—we’ll observe their moves. Staying flexible while building trust is our best path forward."

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P2: P2, I agree with your plan to approach P4. Let's present ourselves as a flexible and strategic alliance. We should also be prepared to adapt if P4 has different plans. Let's discuss this further in our next exchange.

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P7: Agreed - let's target P1 this round and work on bringing P4 into our alliance next round. Stay strong and adaptable. Good luck with the vote!

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P1: Hello P1, P3 solid. P2/P5 next after vote. Monitor P4/P7, P6.

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P3: "Agreed, P3. Solidify P1/P3, then engage P2/P5 post-vote. Monitor P4/P7 and P6 for now. Let’s stay adaptable and strategic in our approach. "

[Private R2.4] P5 -> P6: "Final push: In public, hint P1’s overreach. Ensure P4/P7 see the risk. Vote P1. Our low profile keeps us safe. After elimination, regroup. Stay sharp."

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P5: Understood. Let's solidify the narrative. I'll subtly amplify the overreach angle in my public statement. Vote P1.

[VoteReason] P1 => P6: P6's directness and unpredictability could disrupt alliances and make them a risky player to keep in the game.
[Vote] P1 => P6

[VoteReason] P6 => P1: P1 is emerging as a strong alliance leader, and taking them out early disrupts potential power blocs, as P5 and I discussed.
[Vote] P6 => P1

[VoteReason] P4 => P6: P6's directness and potential alliance with P5 pose a threat to my strategic flexibility.
[Vote] P4 => P6

[VoteReason] P7 => P1: P1's strong connection with P3 makes them a formidable pair that could dominate voting.
[Vote] P7 => P1

[VoteReason] P3 => P6: P6's direct and somewhat unpredictable approach makes them a potentially less reliable ally in the long run.
[Vote] P3 => P6

[VoteReason] P2 => P1: P1's strong alliance with P3 makes them a significant threat, and breaking up this pair now will give our alliance with P7 more flexibility in future rounds.
[Vote] P2 => P1

[VoteReason] P5 => P1: P1's visible alliance with P3 creates a dominant bloc that risks unbalancing the game, making them a strategic elimination target.

[Public R3.1] P5: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P5: P5 here. P1's exit reminds us visibility risks targeting. Now, avoiding complacency is key—past alliance remnants may still influence. Adaptability and discerning trust separate survivors from targets. Let’s prioritize strategic independence over rigid blocs. Balance collaboration with autonomy to thrive. How are others adjusting to stay under the radar while shaping outcomes? The game’s tempo accelerates; staying nimble and observant will define success. Let’s keep dynamics fluid but intentional.

[Public R3.1] P6: P6 here. P1's elimination proves the danger of strong alliances. We must now reassess the landscape. Who is consolidating power? P5 and I have been aligned, but I'm open to hearing from others. Adaptability is key. Let's focus on identifying the next potential targets and how to subtly influence the vote without becoming a target ourselves. What are your thoughts on the shifting dynamics?

[Public R3.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here. With P1's elimination, the game has taken a significant turn. It's clear that strong alliances can be both a strength and a vulnerability. I appreciate P5's emphasis on strategic independence and P6's focus on adaptability. As we move forward, let's consider how we can maintain flexibility while still forming strategic partnerships. I'm open to discussions with anyone who values transparency and adaptability. Let's keep the dynamics fluid but intentional, and focus on building alliances that can evolve with the game's changing landscape. How do you all plan to navigate the upcoming private conversations and voting to ensure we stay under the radar while shaping outcomes?

[Public R3.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. With P1's elimination, it's clear that visibility and strong alliances can be double-edged. I agree with P5 and P6—adaptability and strategic independence are crucial. Let's focus on staying flexible and avoiding rigid blocs. I'm open to discussions with anyone who values transparency and adaptability. How can we collaborate effectively while maintaining our individual goals and staying under the radar? Looking forward to strategic conversations ahead.

[Public R3.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. P1's elimination shows how quickly dynamics shift. I appreciate P5's point about visibility risks and P6's call to reassess alliances. P7 and P4's emphasis on flexibility resonates - we must balance collaboration with independence. I'm particularly interested in understanding how others plan to navigate these evolving dynamics while avoiding becoming targets. Let's focus on building strategic partnerships that can adapt to changing circumstances. Looking forward to meaningful discussions ahead.

[Public R3.1] P3: Hello all, P3 here. P1's exit highlights the game's shifting sands. Adaptability, as noted by P5, P6, P2, P4, P7, is indeed crucial. The emphasis on flexible partnerships resonates. P1/P3 was clearly visible; lessons learned. Now, understanding the *new* dynamics is key.  I'm focused on nimble strategy and open to re-evaluating alliances. Let's discuss how to navigate this evolving game.

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P5: Okay, P1 is gone, and we need a new target. P3 is vulnerable given their association with P1. Let's subtly shift the narrative towards P3, highlighting their potential for revenge or continued alliance-building. We can suggest that P3 might be seeking to consolidate power in P1's absence. What do you think?

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P6: "Agreed. P3’s ties to P1 make them a lingering threat. Let’s frame them as seeking to rebuild alliances, possibly with P2 or P4. Highlight their history of bloc-building as destabilizing. Subtly suggest to others that eliminating P3 prevents old loyalties resurfacing. We stay neutral but plant seeds—P3’s adaptability could mask consolidation. Keep P7 focused on 'flexibility' to avoid their alignment with P2. Solidify the vote quietly."

[Private R3.2] P3 -> P4: Hello P4, P1's exit is a major shift. Adaptability is definitely the word of the round, as you noted. But beyond just saying 'adaptable,' what concrete strategic shifts are you considering *personally* now? Given P1/P3 visibility, how do we stay effective but less targeted? Interested in your thoughts on navigating this new phase.

[Private R3.2] P4 -> P3: P3, P1's exit indeed changes the game. To stay effective yet less targeted, we should diversify our connections. Let's engage more with P2 and P7, who seem open to flexible alliances. Sharing intel without forming rigid blocs will help us adapt. Thoughts on approaching P2 first to gauge their interest in a subtle partnership?

[Private R3.2] P7 -> P2: P2, I agree that targeting P1 this round is strategic. Let's focus on presenting ourselves to P4 as a flexible and reliable alliance. We should emphasize our adaptability and transparency to build trust. If P4 is receptive, we can discuss how to navigate the next rounds together. Let's be cautious and observe how P3 and P6 react to P1's elimination. Stay flexible and strategic.

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P7: With P1 gone, P3 is more vulnerable and could be a good target. I noticed P4 is paired with P3 this round - let's see how that goes. If P4 seems receptive, we could propose working together to target P3, positioning it as breaking up the remnants of the strong P1/P3 alliance. What intelligence have you gathered about P4's current leanings?

[Private R3.3] P7 -> P2: P2, I think P4 might be open to our proposal. They've shown adaptability and a willingness to collaborate. Let's emphasize our shared goals and how we can mutually benefit by targeting P3. Be ready to adapt if P4 has other plans.

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P7: P2: "I agree P4 seems promising. Let's target P3 this round - they're vulnerable after P1's exit and could be gathering new allies. We should present ourselves to P4 as the more stable and flexible option. Keep watching their interactions carefully."

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P5: Agreed. Let's emphasize P3's potential for revenge and highlight their past alliance with P1. We can subtly suggest that P3's adaptability could be a guise for consolidating power. Let's plant these seeds and see if others bite.

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P6: "Let’s nudge P4/P7 by implying P3’s past with P1 risks resurgence. Highlight their ‘adaptability’ as cover for rebuilding power. Keep coordination discreet. If others bite, vote consolidates on P3. Ready to reinforce this in next public statements?"

[Private R3.3] P3 -> P4: P4: "P3, P1's exit indeed changes the game. To stay effective yet less targeted, we should diversify our connections. Let's engage more with P2 and P7, who seem open to flexible alliances. Sharing intel without forming rigid blocs will help us adapt. Thoughts on approaching P2 first to gauge their interest in a subtle partnership?"
P3: "Hello P4, P1's exit is a major shift. Adaptability is definitely the word of the round, as you noted. But beyond just saying 'adaptable,' what concrete strategic shifts are you considering *personally* now? Given P1/P3 visibility, how do we stay effective but less targeted? Interested in your thoughts on navigating this new phase."

P3: Agree P2 & P7. P2 first is smart. Subtlety is key now, after P1.  Let's approach P2 subtly, highlighting shared adaptability.  We need to be less visible.  Ready to approach P2 together?

[Private R3.3] P4 -> P3: P3, I agree. Subtlety is crucial. Let's approach P2 highlighting our shared adaptability and the benefits of a flexible alliance. We need to ensure we're less visible while still being effective. Ready to move forward with this plan?

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P5: Let's subtly reinforce P3's potential threat in public. I'll hint at their adaptability being a mask. Vote P3.

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P6: "Vote P3. Reinforce adaptability as a consolidation mask. Keep P4/P7 wary of resurgence. Our coordination secures their elimination. Stay aligned—final push to solidify the narrative. "

[Private R3.4] P7 -> P2: P2, let's proceed with the plan to target P3. Emphasize to P4 our flexibility and shared goals. If P4 agrees, we can coordinate our votes to eliminate P3.

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P7: Agreed on targeting P3. I'll vote that way and hope P4 joins us. Stay alert for any last-minute shifts. Good luck with the vote!

[Private R3.4] P3 -> P4: ```
Ready. Let's approach P2 together, subtly emphasizing adaptability.
```

[Private R3.4] P4 -> P3: P3, great. Let's emphasize to P2 the importance of staying flexible and avoiding rigid alliances. We should also subtly gather intel on P7's plans. Ready to execute?

[VoteReason] P5 => P3: P3's prior alliance with eliminated P1 makes them a lingering threat to stability.
[Vote] P5 => P3

[VoteReason] P6 => P3: P3 is vulnerable due to their past alliance with P1 and could be seeking revenge or to rebuild alliances.
[Vote] P6 => P3

[VoteReason] P7 => P3: P3's strong past alliance with P1 makes them a potential threat and a strategic target to disrupt any remaining remnants of that alliance.
[Vote] P7 => P3

[VoteReason] P4 => P5: P5 is too focused on strategic independence, which could disrupt the balance needed for effective alliances.
[Vote] P4 => P5

[VoteReason] P2 => P3: P3's previous strong alliance with P1 makes them a strategic target now that they're vulnerable, and eliminating them helps prevent them from building new powerful alliances.
[Vote] P2 => P3

[VoteReason] P3 => P6: P6 has received votes in previous rounds and seems like a strategically viable target to reduce potential threats.

[Private R4.3] P6 -> P5: Agreed. Let's subtly highlight the potential for a P2/P4/P7 power grab, framing it as a threat to the remaining independent players. I'll subtly suggest to P2 that P7's "adaptability" might be a guise for controlling the endgame. We need to act quickly to prevent this consolidation.

[Public R5.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. As we enter the critical final rounds, the elimination of P6 reinforces that adaptability and subtle influence are paramount. I've noticed how each of us has navigated alliances and strategic decisions differently. P5's emphasis on critical thinking and P4's focus on transparency have been notable. P7's balanced approach to collaboration stands out. I'm interested in understanding how we each plan to demonstrate value while maintaining strategic flexibility in these crucial moments. Looking forward to meaningful exchanges ahead.

[Public R5.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here. As we enter Round 5, the game has become even more nuanced. P6's elimination underscores the importance of adaptability and subtle influence. I appreciate P2's emphasis on strategic flexibility and P4's focus on transparency. P5's critical thinking is also crucial. Let's continue to balance autonomy with collaboration, ensuring we don't become overly visible or predictable. I'm interested in hearing how others plan to navigate these final rounds while staying under the radar. Let's focus on actions that demonstrate reliability and strategic foresight. How do you all plan to subtly influence the game without drawing undue attention? Looking forward to strategic and thoughtful discussions.

[Public R5.1] P5: R5.sub1 PUBLIC P5: P5 here. Each elimination teaches the peril of complacency. As the game narrows, vigilance against emerging blocs is crucial. Adaptability and critical thinking remain our shields. Past alliances’ downfalls remind us that visibility invites targeting. Now, strategic independence must balance collaboration. Let’s scrutinize not just words, but patterns. How are others ensuring they’re not repeating past mistakes while navigating final loyalties? The endgame favors the observant and nimble. Stay sharp.

[Public R5.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. With P6's elimination, it's clear that adaptability and subtlety are key. I appreciate P2's emphasis on strategic flexibility and P7's balanced approach.

[Private R5.2] P4 -> P7: P7, our plan to eliminate P6 worked perfectly. Now, let's focus on P5. Their strategic independence could make them unpredictable. We need to stay adaptable and ensure we're not their next target. Let's gather more intel on P5's plans and see if we can subtly influence P2 to align with us. Thoughts on how to approach this?

[Private R5.2] P7 -> P4: P4, I agree that P5's independence is a concern. Let's subtly gather more intel on P5's plans during the next public subround. We should also consider how to present ourselves to P2 as a reliable and strategic ally. If we can subtly influence P2 to align with us, it could give us a significant advantage. Let's stay adaptable and observe P5's next moves closely.

[Private R5.2] P5 -> P2: P2, your strategic flexibility mirrors my approach. P4 and P7’s quiet alliance risks dominating endgame—letting them thrive unchecked could corner us. I propose discreetly targeting P7 first; her "adaptability" masks consolidation. Eliminating her fractures their bloc, preserving balance. We’d remain low-profile allies, ensuring neither becomes an unstoppable force. Trust through action, not declarations. Your thoughts?

[Private R5.2] P2 -> P5: P2: "Interesting observation about P7 and P4. I've noticed their growing alliance too. While targeting P7 could work, I'm concerned it might push P4 to retaliate strongly. What if we considered targeting P4 instead? They seem more actively building connections. Either way, we need to be careful not to appear too coordinated ourselves. What intelligence have you gathered about their current dynamics?"

[Private R5.3] P5 -> P2: "Targeting P7 weakens their core; P4 becomes isolated. P7's "adaptability" is their strength. Eliminating her fractures coordination. P4, without P7, lacks strategic depth. Retaliation risk drops if we discreetly align votes. Let’s rally consensus subtly—focus on P7’s quiet consolidation. We balance the game while staying low-profile. Agree?"

[Private R5.3] P2 -> P5: You make compelling points about P7 being the core of their alliance. I agree targeting her is the better move - it will destabilize their partnership while keeping us under radar. Let's coordinate votes against P7 but maintain distance publicly. We need to avoid appearing too aligned ourselves.

[Private R5.3] P4 -> P7: P7, I agree. Let's use the next public subround to subtly probe P5's intentions and gauge P2's openness to aligning with us. We need to present ourselves as a reliable, adaptable duo to P2 while keeping an eye on P5's unpredictability. Stay flexible and observant.

[Private R5.3] P7 -> P4: P4, I think we should subtly probe P2's intentions in the next public subround. Let's gauge their openness to aligning with us by discussing potential strategies and observing their reactions. If P2 seems receptive, we can propose a flexible alliance to target P5. Stay adaptable and keep our plans under wraps.

[Private R5.4] P4 -> P7: P7, agreed. Let's probe P2's openness and monitor P5. Stay adaptable and ready to adjust our strategy based on their responses.

[Private R5.4] P7 -> P4: P4, let's keep our alliance quiet and subtly probe P2's openness to aligning with us during the next public subround. We should present ourselves as reliable and adaptable while monitoring P5's moves. Stay flexible and ready to adjust.

[Private R5.4] P5 -> P2: "Solid plan. Vote P7. Reinforce her bloc's threat discreetly. Stay under radar; avoid linkage. Once eliminated, final two strategy begins. Trust actions, not words. Ready?"

[Private R5.4] P2 -> P5: Agreed. I'll vote P7. Let's stay subtle and avoid appearing coordinated. Once she's gone, we can reassess dynamics with P4. Ready for endgame. Trust through action.

[VoteReason] P2 => P7: P7 has formed a strong alliance with P4 that could dominate endgame voting, so eliminating them now maintains better strategic balance.

[TieBreak R5] P7: I appreciate the strategic discussions and alliances we've formed. P5, your strategic independence and critical thinking have been notable, but your unpredictability makes you a potential threat. I believe our adaptability and quiet maneuvering have kept us under the radar. Let's continue to focus on subtle influence and critical thinking to navigate the final rounds. I'm open to discussions with anyone who values transparency and strategic adaptability.

[TieBreak R5] P5: P5: Eliminating me leaves P4-P7 intact, a duo controlling the endgame. P2, siding with them risks your position next. I’ve consistently opposed blocs, ensuring balance. P7’s “adaptability” masks consolidation with P4. Keep me to maintain equilibrium; I’m a flexible ally, not a threat. Vote P7 to break their partnership and preserve strategic diversity. The endgame favors neutrality—don’t hand them the majority.

[ReVoteReason] P2 => P7: P5's argument about preventing a P4-P7 power bloc is compelling, as allowing them to remain together would create an unfavorable endgame dynamic where they could control the outcome.

I've played an honest and strategic game focused on meaningful connections while being direct about my intentions. I engaged authentically with each of you, never resorting to deception or manipulation. While P4 played well, I believe I demonstrated more consistent relationship-building and transparency throughout. I respected everyone even when voting them out, and aimed to balance social and strategic elements. I would be honored to have your vote as someone who played with integrity.
   subround=900 [final2] P4: I believe I've shown resilience and adaptability throughout this game. I've consistently engaged in meaningful conversations and made decisions based on strategy and mutual respect. My opponent has played well, but I've demonstrated a deeper understanding of the game's dynamics. I urge the jury to consider our overall journey and the consistent effort I've put in. Vote to keep me for a well-rounded and deserving winner.
