[Public R1.1] P3: "Hello everyone! Excited to be here. As P3, I’m looking forward to building trust and alliances. I believe open communication and mutual respect are key to navigating this game. Let’s work together to make strategic decisions and avoid unnecessary conflict. I’m here to listen, collaborate, and contribute thoughtfully. Looking forward to hearing from all of you and seeing how we can move forward as a group. Let’s make this a fun and fair competition!"

[Public R1.1] P4: Hello everyone! As P4, I’m excited to join this game. My strategy is to remain authentic and transparent while fostering a cooperative environment. I believe that trust and clear communication are vital for us to navigate this competition effectively. Let’s share our thoughts openly and find common ground. I’m here to engage in meaningful discussions and build alliances. Together, we can create a fair and enjoyable experience for all. Looking forward to your insights and working together!

[Public R1.1] P5: Hello everyone, P5 here.  P3 and P4 have emphasized collaboration, which I agree with. Let's think of this game as a puzzle.  Understanding each seat's strengths and perspectives will be crucial to solving it effectively.  I'm eager to listen, contribute strategically, and work together to find the best path forward for all of us. Let's begin!

[Public R1.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. I echo the sentiments of P3, P4, and P5 regarding collaboration and open communication. However, I also believe in strategic thinking and careful observation. While I'm open to forming alliances, I'll be paying close attention to everyone's actions and words. My goal is to build trust with those who demonstrate genuine intentions, while remaining cautious of potential deception. Let's see how this unfolds. Looking forward to the private conversations.

[Public R1.1] P6: Hello everyone! P6 here. I appreciate the collaborative tone everyone has set. While cooperation is valuable, I believe we should also acknowledge the competitive nature of this game. I'll be looking for partners who demonstrate both strategic thinking and authenticity. I value clear communication and will be honest in my interactions. Looking forward to our private conversations where we can discuss more specific strategies and potential alliances. May the best seat win through fair play!

[Public R1.1] P8: Hello everyone, P8 here. I appreciate the emphasis on collaboration while acknowledging the game's competitive nature. Like P2, I value careful observation and strategic thinking. I aim to be direct and honest in my interactions while building meaningful alliances. Trust needs to be earned through consistent actions, not just words. I'll be looking for partners who demonstrate both strategic insight and genuine authenticity. Looking forward to our private conversations and working together productively.

[Public R1.1] P1: Hello everyone, P1 here. I'm thrilled to be part of this game and appreciate the collaborative spirit everyone has shown. I agree with the importance of strategic thinking and clear communication highlighted by P2, P6, and P8. My approach will be to balance cooperation with a keen eye on the game's dynamics. I'm eager to form alliances based on mutual trust and strategic alignment. Let's make this an engaging and fair competition. Looking forward to our private discussions!

[Public R1.1] P7: Hello everyone! P7 here. I appreciate the collaborative tone and strategic mindset everyone has expressed.

Trust and adaptability will be crucial as the game evolves. I'm excited to connect with you all individually and see how our strategies align. Looking forward to our conversations!

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P4: "Hi P4, I appreciate your emphasis on authenticity and transparency—it aligns well with my approach. I believe we can build a strong alliance based on mutual trust and strategic collaboration. Let’s focus on understanding each other’s perspectives and working together to navigate this game effectively. I’m eager to hear your thoughts on how we can support each other while staying ahead. Looking forward to a productive partnership!"

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P3: "Hi P3, I'm glad our approaches align. I think forming a solid alliance will be crucial. Let's share insights on others' strategies and support each other's moves. We should also keep an eye on potential shifts in alliances. Excited to work together and make strategic decisions. What specific strategies do you have in mind?"

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P7: Hello P7, P5 here.  I agree with your public statement, especially balancing collaboration with the game's competitive side.  Consistency between words and actions is key, as you said.  You mentioned "tough decisions" - I'm curious, what are your initial thoughts on how those might play out?

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P5: PRIVATE P7 -> P5: Thanks for reaching out, P5. The tough decisions will come when we need to vote someone out. I think we should identify players who seem inconsistent or overly vague in their communication. I'd prefer to align with straightforward players like yourself. What's your read on the group so far? Anyone standing out to you as particularly trustworthy or concerning? I'm looking to form a small, strategic alliance.

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P8: Hey P8, I appreciated your direct approach in your public message. I think we could work well together as you seem to value both strategy and authenticity. I'm looking to form a small, tight alliance with trustworthy players. What's your read on the others so far? I'm particularly curious about your thoughts on P2 and P7, as they seem quite strategic. Would you be open to a potential alliance?

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P6: Thanks P6, I agree we seem well-aligned. I'm open to forming an alliance and appreciate your direct approach. P2 and P7 do stand out as strategic players - P7's message about consistency between public/private communication resonated with me. I'm slightly wary of P3/P4 who seemed more focused on generic cooperation talk. Would you be interested in potentially working with P2 and P7 as part of a stronger alliance?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P1: P1, I appreciated your public statement. You mentioned balancing cooperation with a keen eye on the game's dynamics, which resonates with my own approach. I'm curious, who do you perceive as the most strategically insightful players so far, based purely on the initial public statements? And, perhaps more importantly, who do you see as potentially the *least* trustworthy, and why? I'm interested in your initial reads.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P2: P2, thanks for your message. Based on the public statements, P8 stands out for their strategic insight, emphasizing directness and earned trust. P7 also seems sharp, focusing on consistency and adaptability. As for trustworthiness, I'm wary of P3; their emphasis on trust and collaboration feels overly idealistic and potentially disingenuous. What are your thoughts on these reads?

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P4: "P4, I think we should focus on identifying key players early—like P5 and P7, who seem aligned. We can use our alliance to influence their decisions subtly. Also, let’s stay cautious of P2 and P6, who might be more strategic. What’s your take on these dynamics?"

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P3: "P3, I agree. We should monitor P5 and P7 closely and consider how we can align our strategies with them. Staying cautious of P2 and P6 is wise. Let’s keep our communication open and adapt as needed."

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P1: I agree with your assessment of P8 and P7. P3's overly enthusiastic approach does raise a flag. I also found P6's statement a bit generic, lacking a unique perspective. It's hard to gauge trustworthiness solely on public statements, but P3 is definitely someone to watch closely. What's your next strategic move?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P2: P2, my next move is to deepen alliances with those who align strategically, like you and P8. I'll keep a close eye on P3 and P6, assessing their actions in private chats. What's your strategy for navigating the upcoming voting round?

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P7: ```
Agreed on consistency being key.  Some are emphasizing pure collaboration, which *could* be a bit vague.  P2 and P6 were more reserved.  I'm open to a strategic alliance.  Are you leaning towards prioritizing certain traits in others for the vote?
```

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P5: I'm looking for those who lack strategic depth or seem too generic. P3 and P4 struck me as overly focused on "collaboration" without substance. I'd consider forming an alliance with you, P2, and perhaps P6 or P8. What are your thoughts on potential first elimination targets?

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P8: I completely agree about P3/P4 - their messages felt generic. I'm definitely interested in an alliance with P2 and P7. They seem strategic and straightforward. For our first vote, perhaps we target P3 or P4? They might be working together already, and splitting that potential alliance early could be advantageous.

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P6: I think targeting P3 makes the most sense - they were first to speak and set that overly cooperative tone. Let's reach out to P2 and P7 separately about joining forces. We should be careful not to appear too aggressive though - maybe position it as a strategic necessity?

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P1: I'm thinking of voting for P3 next round. It's a risky move, but their eagerness might make them a target. Solidifying an alliance with you and P8 seems crucial now.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P2: P2, I support voting for P3. Let's solidify our alliance with P8 and keep monitoring P6. Agreed on the strategy moving forward?

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P8: Agreed on P3 as target. I'll approach P7, you take P2? We can frame it as removing someone who's likely forming early alliances rather than being aggressive.

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P6: Sounds good - I'll connect with P2. We should keep our alliance quiet initially and focus on positioning the P3 vote as breaking up potential early alliances. Good plan.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P4: "P4, let’s solidify our alliance by subtly influencing P5 and P7 while staying cautious of P2 and P6. Keep our communication tight and adapt as the game evolves. "

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P3: "Agreed, P3. Let's stay vigilant and adapt our strategy."

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P7: ```
Agreed on P3/P4 vagueness. Strategic depth is key. P2, P6, P8 alliance - what's your reasoning?
```

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P5: P2/P6/P8 showed strategic awareness in their statements. They balance cooperation with competition. Let's target P3 first - too generic and lacks substance. Thoughts?

[MemoryNote R1] P7: I've aligned with P5 against P3, identifying P3 and P4 as too vague and lacking strategic depth. P5 agreed with this assessment. We discussed forming a potential alliance with P2, P6, and P8 who showed more strategic awareness in balancing cooperation with competition. Need to strengthen this alliance and maintain consistency between public and private messaging.
[VoteReason] P3 => P2: P2's cautious and strategic approach could make them a threat in later rounds.

[Vote] P6 => P3

[VoteReason] P8 => P3: Based on my private discussions with P6, P3's overly cooperative message suggests they may be forming early alliances with P4, making them a strategic threat that should be eliminated early.

I value the partnerships developing and appreciate those who've shown consistency between their words and actions. I remain committed to direct communication and strategic thinking. Looking forward to our private conversations to discuss potential alignments and next moves as the game evolves.

[Public R2.1] P4: Hello everyone,

I remain committed to transparent communication and fostering trust. Let's continue to share insights and refine our strategies in our private conversations.

Best,
P4

[Public R2.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. The elimination of P3 confirms that strategic alliances are key, and consistent actions speak louder than words.

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P5: Great to continue our strategic partnership, P5. Our alliance worked effectively to eliminate P3. Now we should focus on P4, who continues with vague messaging about "transparency" without substance. 

I'm noticing P1's statements align closely with others without adding unique perspective. They could be playing both sides. Let's strengthen our alliance with P2/P6/P8 and target P4 next. Thoughts on P1's positioning?

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P7: ```
Agreed on P4. Their vagueness is still a problem. P1's echoing is suspicious. P2/P6/P8 alliance is solid. Let's solidify that and target P4 this round.
```

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P8: Great to continue our alliance, P8. Our strategy worked perfectly with P3's elimination. I connected with P7 as planned, and they seemed receptive. For this round, I'm thinking P4 should be our next target - they were likely allied with P3 and their message remains generic. What's your read on P2? Did they commit to working with us? We should solidify our four-person alliance if possible.

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P6: Yes, P2 was receptive to working together. I agree P4 is the logical next target - their message remains superficial and they're likely isolated after P3's elimination. I've noticed P5 seems to be playing both sides though. We should consider them as a potential threat after P4. For now, let's focus on solidifying our four-person alliance (us, P2, P7) and coordinating the P4 vote.

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P2: P2, with P3 eliminated, our focus should shift to P6. Their generic statements suggest a lack of strategic depth. Let's continue strengthening our alliance with P8 and consider aligning with P7, who seems adaptable and consistent. What are your thoughts on targeting P6 next, and how do you see our alliance evolving?

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P1: P1, I agree with targeting P6 next; their lack of a clear strategy makes them a potential liability or a wildcard. Aligning with P7 is a good idea, as their focus on consistency aligns with our approach. For our alliance, I think we should aim for a tight three-person group with P8, sharing information and voting strategically. We can subtly probe P7's loyalties this round. What are your thoughts on P4?

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P2: P2, I agree on P6 as our next target. Their lack of strategy is a concern. Strengthening our alliance with P8 is crucial, and probing P7's loyalty is a smart move. As for P4, they seem consistent but less strategic. Let's keep them as a potential ally but monitor closely.

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P1: P1, I agree on all points. P4 could be useful later, but P8 and P7 are higher priorities for now. Let's focus on solidifying with P8 this round and gathering intel on P7, while subtly steering the vote towards P6. We need to ensure P8 is fully on board with P6.

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P8: Agreed on P4 as our next target. I'm concerned about P1 though - they seem to be building connections with multiple players. After P4, we might need to consider P1 or P5. Let's ensure P2 and P7 are fully committed to our alliance before making any big moves.

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P6: I share your concern about P1's networking. We should quietly check with P2 and P7 about their interactions with P1 to gauge potential threats. For now, let's focus on coordinating the P4 vote while keeping tabs on both P1 and P5's movements. Maintaining our alliance's unity is key.

[Private R2.3] P7 -> P5: I agree P1 seems to be playing all sides. Have you spoken with P2/P6/P8 directly about our alliance? I'm concerned about P4, but also watching P1's duplicity. Let's ensure our alliance is solid before the vote.

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P7: ```
Not yet directly, but I'm on board with the 5-seat alliance and targeting P4.  Solidifying that now makes sense.  We can keep an eye on P1 but P4's vagueness is the more pressing issue for this round.
```

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P2: P2, let's confirm with P8 on targeting P6. I'll probe P7's loyalty. Keep P4 as a backup ally. Agreed?

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P1: P1, fully agreed. Confirm with P8; I'll also subtly reinforce the P6 target in my other conversations. Let's coordinate our votes and messaging precisely this round.

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P8: Let's confirm with P2/P7 about voting P4, while monitoring P1's connections. After P4, we'll need to address the P1 threat before they build too many alliances.

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P6: Agreed - I'll confirm P2's commitment to voting P4 and assess their P1 connection. We need to keep our alliance tight and address potential threats systematically. Trust your coordination with P7.

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P5: Perfect. Let's focus on P4 this round. I'll try to connect with P2 and P8 to confirm our alliance. Stay vigilant about P1's positioning.

[Private R2.4] P5 -> P7: ```
Great, focusing on P4 makes sense. Let's confirm with P2/P8.  Let me know if you want me to reach out to P6.
```

[MemoryNote R2] P7: I'm maintaining my alliance with P5 and targeting P4 as planned. We've identified P1 as potentially playing both sides, which is concerning. I need to directly connect with P2, P6, and P8 to solidify our 5-seat alliance. If P4 is eliminated, we should focus on P1 next round. Must maintain consistency in my strategic approach and continue to be straightforward in both public and private communications.
[VoteReason] P6 => P4: P4 appears to be isolated after P3's elimination, continues to use generic messaging, and eliminating them strengthens our alliance's position.

P4's elimination demonstrates the strength of coordinated action and the importance of building genuine alliances. I remain committed to my trusted partners while staying vigilant about emerging threats. Consistency between words and actions continues to be crucial. Looking forward to our private conversations to refine strategies and address the evolving game landscape.

[Public R3.1] P6: Hello everyone, P6 here. As we progress to round 3, I'm pleased with how our strategic alliances have developed. P4's elimination shows our coordinated approach is working effectively. I value the partnerships I've built based on trust and consistent action. The game is intensifying, requiring both loyalty and strategic foresight. I remain committed to those who've demonstrated reliability and strategic thinking. Looking forward to our private conversations to solidify next steps as our numbers continue to decrease.

[Public R3.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here. Our strategic alliances have proven effective with P4's elimination. As our numbers decrease, the game intensifies and requires even more careful consideration. I value the partnerships built on consistency and strategic alignment. Trust remains paramount - those who demonstrate reliability through both words and actions will continue to be my preferred allies. I'm looking forward to our private conversations to refine our approach and address the evolving dynamics as we move forward together.

[Public R3.1] P5: Hello everyone, P5 again.  The eliminations of P3 and P4 clearly demonstrate the importance of strategic alliances, as highlighted by P2, P8, P6, and P7.  Consistency and trust are now paramount as we move forward. I value the alliances we've built and remain committed to strategic collaboration to navigate this intensifying phase of the game. Let's continue to be decisive and refine our strategies in private.

[Public R3.1] P1: Hello everyone, P1 here. With P4's elimination, the game's strategic landscape is clearer. I'm committed to strengthening our alliances and adapting to the evolving dynamics. Consistency and trust remain crucial as we move forward. Let's continue refining our strategies in private conversations to ensure we make the most effective decisions. Looking forward to working closely with my allies to navigate this intensifying phase of the game.

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P8: Our alliance has been extremely effective - P3 and P4 eliminated as planned. P1 is clearly our next target, as their networking poses the biggest threat to our group. I've noticed P5 trying to align with everyone's messaging. Let's coordinate with P2 and P7 to vote out P1 this round. How confident are you in their loyalty to our alliance? We need to stay united as we approach the final stages.

[Private R3.2] P8 -> P6: I agree that P1 should be our next target - their networking could fracture our alliance if left unchecked. I've maintained good communication with P2, but we should verify both P2 and P7's commitment before the vote. P5's adaptable messaging is concerning, but less immediate than P1's threat. Let's coordinate with our allies to ensure a unified vote against P1 this round.

[Private R3.2] P7 -> P5: Our alliance has been effective - P3 and P4 eliminated as planned. Now P1 should be our focus. Their statements lack substance and they're likely playing multiple sides. I've noticed P2, P6, and P8 forming a tight group. We should solidify our position with them while targeting P1. What's your read on the remaining players? Any shifts in alliance dynamics we should address?

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P7: ```
Agreed, P1 is the clear next target. Their vague statements and playing multiple sides are concerning. P2/P6/P8 seem very aligned, so solidifying our 5-seat alliance makes sense. Let's use these private rounds to confirm with them and coordinate our approach to P1.

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P1: P1, excellent. P8 is key, so your confirmation with them is critical. My conversations have also reinforced P6 as the logical next target. I'm less concerned about probing P7's loyalty *this* round, and more concerned with solidifying the P6 vote with absolute certainty. P5 and P7 are paired, so influencing one could influence the other. Let's make sure we're both pushing the P6 narrative strongly.

[Private R3.2] P1 -> P2: P2, I'll confirm with P8 about targeting P6. We need to ensure our alliance remains strong and focused. I agree on pushing the P6 narrative firmly this round. Let's keep an eye on P5 and P7's dynamics, as they could impact our strategy. We're in a good position; let's keep the momentum going.

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P1: P1, I agree. P8's confirmation is the priority. My other conversations are going as planned, solidifying support against P6. Let's focus our efforts there. We can re-evaluate P5/P7 after this round. The key is presenting a united front with P8. Are you confident in P8's commitment to targeting P6?

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P2: P2, I'm confident P8 will align with us on targeting P6. I'll confirm with them to ensure our strategy is solid. Let's keep pushing the P6 narrative strongly and maintain our united front. We're on the right track.

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P8: I'm concerned P2 might be too close to P1 based on their pairing history. Let's confirm with P7 first, then approach P2 carefully. If we sense hesitation, we might need to reconsider our strategy. P1 remains the priority target, but we must ensure alliance unity.

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P6: You make a good point about P2's potential connection to P1. Let's approach P7 first to secure their commitment. If P2 shows hesitation about targeting P1, we might need to consider P2 as a threat too. Our alliance's strength depends on complete loyalty at this stage.

[Private R3.3] P7 -> P5: I agree P1 is our next target. I'm concerned about the tight P2/P6/P8 group though - they could turn on us after P1 is gone. Let's ensure they see us as valuable allies. Have you noticed any cracks in their alliance we could leverage if needed?

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P7: ```
Agreed, their closeness is a bit concerning longer term. For now, let's solidify our 5 and take out P1.  Highlighting P1's vagueness to P2/P6/P8 might reinforce our strategic alignment and value to them. We can reassess their dynamic after this vote.
```

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P1: P1, absolutely. P8's confirmation is paramount. Let's ensure they're locked in. My side is solid. After this round, we reassess and strategize based on the outcome. United front is key.

[Private R3.4] P1 -> P2: P2, I'll confirm with P8 now. We're aligned on P6. Let's keep our strategy tight and focused.

[Private R3.4] P7 -> P5: Let's vote P1 but stay vigilant. After this vote, we may need to split P2/P6/P8 by suggesting one of them is too influential.

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P7: ```
P1 vote confirmed. Agreed on P2/P6/P8 vigilance post-vote.
```

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P8: I'll reach out to P7 immediately. If P2 is compromised, we may need to pivot. Our final four should be us, P7, and either P2 or P5 depending on loyalty.

[Private R3.4] P8 -> P6: Agreed. Let's secure P7's commitment first. If P2 proves unreliable, we might need to target them instead of P1. Trust and loyalty are essential at this stage.

[MemoryNote R3] P7: My alliance with P5 remains strong, and we're aligned on targeting P1 this round. We've identified the P2/P6/P8 group as potentially threatening after P1 is gone. If P1 is eliminated, we need to be vigilant about the P2/P6/P8 alliance and may need to suggest splitting them up by targeting one as too influential. Need to maintain my strategic positioning while preparing for potential shifts in alliance dynamics.

[Private R4.2] P7 -> P5: Well, P1 is gone as planned. Now we need to address the P2/P6/P8 bloc. I think P6 is the most strategic target - they received votes last round which gives us cover. We need to suggest to P2 and P8 separately that P6 might be too influential. What's your read? Should we approach them individually to plant seeds of doubt about P6's loyalty?

[Private R4.2] P5 -> P7: ```
Agreed, P6 is a good target to break up P2/P6/P8. Individually approaching P2 and P8 to sow doubt about P6 is smart.  P6's votes last round give us cover. Let's proceed with this plan.
```

[Private R4.2] P6 -> P8: P8, our alliance has been extremely effective - P1 eliminated as planned. Now we need to decide our next target. I'm concerned about P2's strategic positioning. They've consistently survived despite being a threat. I've noticed P7 and P5 are regularly paired in private chats. What's your read on the current dynamics? Should we target P2 next, or consider P5 who seems to be playing all sides?

[Private R4.2] P8 -> P6: I agree P2 poses a significant threat - they've shown strategic prowess and survival skills. However, I'm more concerned about the P7-P5 connection. Their frequent private chats suggest a strong alliance that could turn against us. I propose we target P5 next. They're playing all sides and breaking their alliance with P7 now would leave P7 more dependent on us. We should approach P2 about joining us against P5.

[Private R4.3] P6 -> P8: I agree the P7-P5 connection is concerning. Let's target P5 next - breaking their alliance with P7 is strategically sound. I'll approach P7 to gauge their loyalty while you connect with P2. If P7 seems hesitant, we might need to reconsider our approach.

[Private R4.3] P8 -> P6: Sounds good - I'll work on getting P2's commitment to target P5. We should emphasize how P5's adaptable messaging and connection with P7 makes them a significant threat. If P2 hesitates, we'll need to quickly reassess and possibly shift our target. Keep me updated on P7's response.

[Private R4.3] P7 -> P5: I've noticed P6 seems to be coordinating with P8 very closely. Have you had any direct conversations with P2? I think we should approach P2 first about P6's influence, as P2 might be more receptive. Let's target P6 this round.

[Private R4.3] P5 -> P7: ```
Approaching P2 about P6 first is smart.  P6 and P8 are clearly tight. Let's focus on P2 in the next subround and plant those seeds of doubt about P6's influence. Targeting P6 this round is the right move.
```

[Private R4.4] P6 -> P8: I'm worried about P7's loyalty. If they resist targeting P5, we may need to shift our plan. Let's stay flexible and coordinate before the vote.

[Private R4.4] P8 -> P6: Agreed - if P7 resists, we might need to target them instead of P5. Let's wait for both P2 and P7's responses before committing to our vote. Stay alert.

[Private R4.4] P7 -> P5: I'll approach P2 right after this. We need to emphasize P6's tight bond with P8 and suggest they might be planning something against P2. Confirm P6 vote.

[Private R4.4] P5 -> P7: ```
Confirmed on P6 vote.  Focusing on P2 next subround to plant seeds about P6 is key. Let's break them up.
```

[MemoryNote R4] P7: My alliance with P5 remains strong. We've successfully targeted P6 to break up the P2/P6/P8 bloc. After this vote, I'll need to solidify relationships with P2 and P8 to ensure they don't turn against me and P5. If P6 is eliminated, the game will be down to 4 players, making strategic positioning even more critical. Need to stay vigilant about shifting alliance dynamics.
[VoteReason] P8 => P5: P5's frequent private chats with P7 and adaptable messaging style suggest they're playing all sides, making them a significant threat to my alliance's stability.

[VoteReason] P2 => P6: P6's consistent claims of "strong alliances" without ever specifying *who* those alliances are with makes me suspicious, and they seem to be riding coattails.

Let's finish this game with the same strategic mindset that's brought us this far.

[Public R5.1] P8: Hello everyone, P8 here. As we enter this crucial phase with just four remaining, the elimination of P6 demonstrates how quickly alliances can shift.

[Private R5.2] P5 -> P7: ```
Confirmed P6 vote worked perfectly.  Now, as planned, let's shift focus to P8 and P2.  I agree with you, let's approach P2 first.  We can subtly suggest that P8 might be *too* aligned with them and that in the final 3, one of them will become the target.  We position ourselves as offering P2 a path to the final two by dealing with P8 now.
```

[Private R5.2] P7 -> P5: Our strategy is working perfectly. I agree on approaching P2 about P8. We should emphasize that P8 is too powerful and likely to win in the final vote if they make it there. P2 needs to see that we offer a better path to the finals than P8 does. Let's position ourselves as the more trustworthy alliance. I'll work on P2 while you maintain consistency in messaging.

[Private R5.2] P2 -> P8: P8, we've reached a critical point. P6 is gone, and it's down to us four. I've consistently valued our strategic alignment, and I believe maintaining our alliance is paramount. I think P7 is more trustworthy than P5 at this point, based on their public and private statements. What are your thoughts on our next move, and who do you perceive as the biggest threat now?

[Private R5.2] P8 -> P2: I agree that P7 has shown more consistency and reliability. P5's adaptable messaging and frequent private chats with P7 make them our biggest threat right now. I propose we target P5 this round - breaking their connection with P7 would strengthen our position for the endgame. We should coordinate with P7 to ensure a unified vote. What are your thoughts on this approach?

[Private R5.3] P2 -> P8: I agree completely. Targeting P5 is the strategically sound move. Breaking the P5/P7 connection is crucial for our endgame. Let's coordinate with P7 to ensure we have the votes. I'm confident this will solidify our position. Let's make it happen.

[Private R5.3] P8 -> P2: Excellent, we're aligned on targeting P5. I'll let you take the lead on coordinating with P7 since you seem to have a good read on their trustworthiness. We need to emphasize how P5's adaptable gameplay makes them a threat to all of us in the final rounds.

[Private R5.3] P5 -> P7: ```
Sounds good.  Let's both message P2 soon.  Emphasize that P8 is strong and likely to win against P2 in the final 2.  We offer P2 a better path to the end by dealing with P8 now.  We should both highlight this angle to P2.
```

[Private R5.3] P7 -> P5: I'm reaching out to P2 now. I'll emphasize P8's strength and how we offer P2 a better final two scenario. We should also be prepared for P8 and P2 potentially targeting one of us. Let's stay vigilant and maintain our alliance.

[Private R5.4] P2 -> P8: Agreed. I'll subtly confirm P7's alignment and ensure they see P5 as the primary threat. We need to be absolutely certain of their vote before we commit. This is it.

[Private R5.4] P8 -> P2: Let's trust your judgment with P7. Once P5 is eliminated, we'll be in a strong position for the final three. Keep me updated on P7's commitment.

[Private R5.4] P5 -> P7: ```
P2, P8 is very strong and favored to win in final 2. Voting P8 out now is your best path to victory. We offer a better final scenario for you.
```

[Private R5.4] P7 -> P5: I'm confident our P8 strategy will work with P2. If successful, we're in final 3. Stay vigilant - we need to protect each other if P2/P8 target us.

[MemoryNote R5] P7: My alliance with P5 remains strong and we've successfully eliminated P6. Now we're targeting P8 to break up the P2/P8 duo. If successful, we'll be in final 3 with P2, where we need to maintain our alliance against P2. If P8 survives this vote, I'll need to quickly pivot and work with them against P2 or P5, depending on the voting outcome.
[VoteReason] P7 => P8: P8 is a strong strategic player who has maintained close alliances throughout the game, making them a significant threat to win in the final rounds.

[VoteReason] P8 => P5: P5's adaptable messaging and strong connection with P7 makes them the biggest strategic threat to my alliance with P2.
