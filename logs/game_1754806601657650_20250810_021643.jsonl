P3 lied to P4, blindsided P2, pitched against P6, and today he stands here thanks to comp luck, not loyalty. Reward the game that valued relationships over tricks. Keep the seat that listened to your perspectives in every DM and protected you when I could. Send P3 out; let integrity claim the crown.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 04:47:09"}

I sought consensus rather than chaos, and I protected relationships—even with those I voted out. P5 often hid behind others’ moves and overpromised, then flipped when convenient.
