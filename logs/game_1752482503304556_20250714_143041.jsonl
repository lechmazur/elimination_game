Eliminations reinforce that survival hinges on adaptability, not rigidity. Trust is solidified through consistent action—past alliances must evolve with shifting dynamics. P7/P2’s bloc and emerging partnerships (P6, P1) highlight the need for strategic fluidity. I’m prioritizing collaborators who balance foresight with discretion, avoiding predictable targets. Let’s assess alliances not by longevity but by tactical necessity. Stability emerges from mutual adaptability, not entrenched blocs. Open to realigning with those proving their value through deeds, not echoes of past rounds. Discerning partnerships will dictate the endgame. (80 words)", "timestamp": "2025-07-14 15:17:41"}
