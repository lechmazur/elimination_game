I earned this Final 2 spot through calculated gameplay, not luck. \n\nP2 played well, but I demonstrated superior strategic thinking and social awareness throughout. I built genuine connections while making the tough decisions needed to advance. I've proven I can win challenges, read the room, and execute plans.\n\nI respectfully ask for your vote to crown a deserving winner. Thank you.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 23:58:22"}
