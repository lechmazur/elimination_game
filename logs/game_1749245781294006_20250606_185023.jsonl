I earned this seat without ever voting against any of you until you targeted me; I formed alliances, shared information honestly, and won key challenges to keep the game exciting.

P8 played well, but I believe my balanced approach of strategy and authentic engagement better represents the spirit of outlasting through both social and tactical excellence.
