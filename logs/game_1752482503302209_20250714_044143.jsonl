P5, while strong, prioritized self-interest over group cohesion—risking stability for short-term gains. I adapted, listened, and earned this spot through consistency. You deserve a winner who valued this journey holistically. Vote to keep me, and I’ll honor your faith with a victory built on loyalty, not opportunism.
