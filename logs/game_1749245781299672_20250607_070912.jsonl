Throughout this game, I've demonstrated strategic thinking and reliability. My alliance with P4 and P6 was built on mutual trust and execution. I've consistently prioritized decisive action and calculated decisions. While P4 and P6 have shown strengths, I've been the steady partner. The jury will value consistency and strategic gameplay. I believe my track record positions me well for the final stretch. I'm committed to outlasting the others through precision and calculated decisions. Let's see who can truly outlast.", "timestamp": "2025-06-07 07:33:51"}
