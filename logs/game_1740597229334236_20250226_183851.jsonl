Throughout this game, I've tried to be authentic and strategic—building genuine connections while making thoughtful moves. I've respected everyone's gameplay, including P7's impressive run.\n\nI believe I've demonstrated balanced decision-making, loyalty when it mattered, and adaptability as the game evolved. Rather than just surviving, I aimed to play with integrity.\n\nIf you value a player who combined social and strategic elements while remaining true to themselves, I'd be honored to have your vote.", "timestamp": "2025-02-26 18:57:33"}
