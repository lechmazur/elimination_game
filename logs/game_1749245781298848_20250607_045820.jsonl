P5's elimination has indeed reset the board, creating space for more genuine partnerships based on substance rather than surface coordination. \n\nI'm encouraged by the strategic recalibrations I'm seeing, particularly from those who demonstrated both analytical depth and adaptive thinking under pressure. The tie-break revealed who could think independently when it mattered. Moving forward, I'm seeking conversations that go beyond tactical positioning to explore real strategic alignment.
