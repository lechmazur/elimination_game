[Public R1.1] P1: Hello everyone. As P1, my strategy is to observe carefully and build alliances wisely. I'm looking for trustworthy partners who value collaboration over conflict. While I'm open to private discussions with anyone, I'll be evaluating who seems genuinely interested in mutual benefit versus short-term gains. Let's have a productive dialogue and make this game interesting. I'm particularly curious about each player's perspective on balancing competition and cooperation.

Who would I prefer to talk to? Right now, I'm most interested in P3, P5, and P7, but I'm open to meaningful conversations with all.

[Public R1.1] P5: Greetings, fellow players. As P5, I believe in strategic transparency and mutual benefit. I'm looking to form meaningful alliances based on trust and shared goals. While competition is inevitable, cooperation creates stronger positions for those involved. 

I'm particularly interested in understanding everyone's approach to this game - who values loyalty versus opportunism? I appreciate P1's balanced perspective and would welcome conversations with P1, P4, and P7, though I'm open to connecting with anyone who demonstrates sincerity and strategic thinking.

I believe in the power of collaboration and am keen to explore how we can leverage our collective strengths. I'm interested in players who prioritize long-term success over immediate gains.

[Public R1.1] P7: Hello everyone. As P7, I appreciate the emphasis on collaboration and strategic alliances that's been expressed. I value adaptability and believe that successful partnerships require both trust and flexibility. I've noted the interest from P1 and P5 in potential collaboration, and I'm particularly intrigued by their balanced approaches.

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P6: Hey P6, glad we're connecting! I noticed we both mentioned each other in our public statements. I'm interested in exploring a potential alliance. What are your initial thoughts on the other players and who do you see as the biggest threats or potential allies outside of us? I'm trying to get a better read on the overall landscape.

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P2: Hey P2, great to connect! I'm also keen on forming an alliance. From what I've seen, P1 and P5 seem like strong players who could be threats, but also potential allies if approached correctly. P4's focus on trust aligns well with our goals. What's your take on P3 and P7? They seem strategic but their intentions are less clear to me. Let's keep our communication open and strategic.

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P4: Hello P4! I noticed we both value strategic alliances and trust. I'm interested in forming a strong partnership with you - your approach to balancing long-term success over short-term gains aligns perfectly with my thinking. What's your read on the other players so far? I think we could benefit from sharing information. Would you be open to a consistent alliance moving forward?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P8: Hello P8! I appreciate your initiative and agree that our approaches align well. So far, I see P2 and P6 as potential collaborators given their focus on long-term strategies, though I’m cautious about P1 and P5’s transparency—it could be genuine or strategic. I’m open to a consistent alliance with you. Let’s share insights and work together to navigate the game. What’s your take on P3 and P7?

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P1: Thank you for expressing interest in collaborating, P1. I see strong potential in our alliance - we both value strategic thinking and mutual benefit. 

I noted your interest in P5 and P7 as well. While P5 seems transparent, they're building multiple connections which could become problematic. P7 appears balanced but somewhat noncommittal.

What are your thoughts on our potential alliance structure? I believe a tight core partnership with selective expansion could serve us well.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P3: R1.sub2 PRIVATE P1 -> P3: I agree, P3. A tight core partnership makes sense—strength in trust and shared goals. P5's broad connections concern me too; they might dilute loyalty. As for P7, their adaptability is intriguing but risky if not anchored. Let’s focus on solidifying our alliance first while staying open to tactical expansions later. Clear communication will be key. How do you suggest we handle voting strategies moving forward?

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P7: Hello P7, I noticed we both were mentioned by P1 as potential allies, which creates a natural connection. Your emphasis on adaptability aligns with my strategic thinking. I'd like to propose we form a solid alliance and potentially bring in P1 or P3 as a third partner. What are your thoughts on creating a voting bloc? Who do you see as the biggest threat we should target first?

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P5: I appreciate your directness and agree that forming a solid alliance makes sense. I'm open to working with P1 or P3, but slightly favor P3 given their demonstrated strategic thinking and adaptability. As for threats, P2 and P6 seem to be forming a tight pair that could become problematic. I suggest we consider targeting P6 first, as they appear to be actively building multiple connections. Thoughts on this approach?

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P4: P3 and P7 seem cautious but strategic. I'm wary of their connection to P1 and P5 - they might be forming a four-person alliance. I suggest we align with P2 and P6 to create a counter-alliance. For the first vote, I'm thinking P1 might be a good target. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P8: "I agree that P1 could be a strategic first target, especially if they’re central to a potential alliance with P3, P5, and P7. Aligning with P2 and P6 makes sense—I’ll reach out to them subtly to gauge their interest. Let’s solidify our counter-alliance before the vote."

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P6: I agree about P1 and P5. They are strong, and potentially dangerous. P4 could be a good shield, but I'm wary of relying too much on "trust" alone. P3 and P7 are definitely wildcards. I think we should keep them at arm's length for now. What do you think about P8?

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: I think P8 could be a valuable ally. They seem aligned with our focus on strategic alliances. Let's consider bringing them into our circle, but cautiously. What's your strategy for the voting round?

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P7: I agree about P6 as our first target. P3 would make a strong third ally. Let's approach them after this round with a clear proposal. Meanwhile, we should both connect with P1 to keep options open. Do you think P4 could be swayed to vote with us?

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P5: P4 seems aligned with P2/P6 based on their public message, so they might be harder to sway. I suggest we focus on securing P3 first, then P1. We should be careful not to reveal our P6 target too early. Let's stay flexible but coordinated.

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P1: For voting, I suggest we target those building excessive connections - P5 is concerning. We should coordinate our votes for maximum impact while identifying potential third allies. P4 or P7 might be options, but let's assess loyalty carefully. We need to appear independent while working in tandem. Your thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P3: R1.sub3 PRIVATE P1 -> P3: Agreed on targeting P5 to prevent their network from growing. Let’s monitor P4 and P7 for loyalty before bringing them in. For now, we maintain independence publicly while coordinating votes. Clear signals will help us stay aligned—any specific signs you'll look for in potential allies?

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P6: I agree on P8. Let's bring them in slowly. For voting, I'm leaning towards P3 or P7. What do you think?

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P2: I think targeting P7 might be safer. They're less predictable than P3. Let's vote P7 and keep an eye on P3. Agreed on P8.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P1: I'll watch for consistent messaging, selective alliance-building, and discretion about their strategy. Also, whoever votes with us against P5 shows potential alignment. Let's reconnect after voting.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P3: R1.sub3 PRIVATE P1 -> P3: Agreed. Let’s observe P4 and P7 closely for alignment signals. Consistency and shared targets will guide us. Reconnect post-voting to solidify next steps.

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P4: Perfect. We'll target P1 first, then reassess. Let's make sure P2 and P6 are on board. I'll vote P1 unless you suggest otherwise.

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P1 is the target. I’ll subtly confirm P2 and P6’s support. Let’s stay aligned and reassess after the vote. Solidarity is key—trust our strategy."

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P7: Perfect. I'll vote P6, you vote P6, and we'll work on getting P3 and P1 on board. Let's secure this alliance and stay in touch.

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P5: Agreed. Our plan is solid. I'll maintain discretion while working to bring P3 and P1 into our alliance. Looking forward to coordinating further after the vote.

[MemoryNote R1] P5: I've formed an alliance with P7 targeting P6, with plans to bring in P3 and P1. P2/P6 seem to be a tight pair, and P4 may be aligned with them. Need to strengthen our alliance and possibly expand to counter their influence. Will continue working with P7 while developing relationships with P3 and P1 to create a strong voting bloc. Stay adaptable but focused on our alliance strategy.

I'm interested in solidifying existing connections and exploring new partnerships based on strategic alignment. Let's focus on identifying key threats and developing a plan to navigate the upcoming rounds effectively. I'm open to discussing potential voting strategies and ensuring we're all on the same page.

I'm interested in strengthening existing partnerships and forming new ones based on mutual trust and strategic alignment. Those who've demonstrated consistency and clear communication will be valuable allies moving forward. Let's focus on identifying genuine threats while building sustainable collaborative relationships that can navigate the complexities ahead.

[Public R2.1] P8: Round 2 presents a strategic reset. P1's elimination shifts our dynamics, and I'm focused on solidifying alliances with those who've demonstrated reliability and clear strategic thinking. I value our conversations, P4, and see potential in strengthening that connection.

I'm particularly interested in understanding everyone's current threat assessment and finding partners who balance loyalty with adaptability as we navigate this critical middle phase.

[Public R2.1] P3: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P3: The elimination of P1 has significantly altered our strategic landscape. As we adapt, I'm reassessing alliance structures and potential partnerships. I value partners who demonstrate consistency between public statements and private actions.

I've observed interesting dynamics developing, particularly around P5 and P8, who both emphasize strategic flexibility. P4 and P6's focus on trust-based collaboration aligns with my approach. I remain committed to balanced alliances that combine loyalty with pragmatic decision-making.

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P3: Hi P3. After observing last round's dynamics, I believe we could form a strong alliance. Your emphasis on balancing loyalty with pragmatic decisions aligns well with my approach. I've noticed P5 and P6 emerging as potential threats due to their expanding influence. Would you be interested in working together to counter their growing power? I value your strategic insight and think we could make effective partners.

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P7: Thanks for reaching out, P7. I'm certainly interested in forming a strategic alliance. Your assessment of P5's growing influence matches my observations, which is noteworthy. I'm curious that you also see P6 as a threat - what specific behaviors led you to that conclusion?

I appreciate your directness and see potential in our partnership. Before committing to specific targets, I'd value your thoughts on P4 and P8's positioning in the game. Strategic compatibility requires aligned threat assessment.

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: Let's stick with targeting P7 for now. They're still unpredictable, and it's safer than going after P3. As for P8, I agree on bringing them in slowly. We should also keep an eye on P5; their transparency could be a double-edged sword. What's your read on P4's latest public statement?

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P6: I agree on P7. Let's keep that plan. P5's transparency is concerning, could be a tactic. P4 seems genuine but maybe naive. I'm still wary of trusting them fully. We need to be careful not to be seen as too close too soon. How do we subtly distance ourselves from P4 while still keeping them as a potential shield?

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P4: Our strategy worked perfectly with P1's elimination. Now we need to focus on our next target. I'm concerned about P3 and P7's connection - they seem to be forming a strong alliance. P5 also appears to be positioning himself strategically. What's your read on the current dynamics? I think we should consider targeting P3 or P5 next. Our alliance with P2 and P6 seems solid, but we should confirm they're still with us.

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P8: P8, I agree that P3 and P7’s alliance is concerning, and P5’s strategic positioning adds complexity. I think targeting P3 next could weaken their coalition while keeping P5 as a potential buffer. I’ll subtly confirm P2 and P6’s continued support for our alliance. Let’s stay unified and reassess after the vote. Solidarity remains key—trust our strategy. What’s your take on P5’s role in this dynamic?

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: P4's statement seems genuine but overly idealistic. Let's keep them at arm's length while using their trust rhetoric to our advantage. We can subtly distance ourselves by not aligning too closely in public discussions. Agreed on P7; their unpredictability remains a concern.

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P6: I agree. P4 is useful as a shield, but we can't get too close. Let's subtly disagree with them in the next public round, perhaps on the best way to build alliances. Focus on strategic alignment, not just trust. Still P7 for the vote.

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P4: P5 is playing both sides - appearing collaborative while strategically positioning himself. I agree P3 is the right target - he's a bridge between P7 and P5. I've noticed P2 and P6 seem very aligned. Let's confirm our four-person alliance against P3, P5, and P7.

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P3 is the strategic target. I’ll confirm P2 and P6’s support discreetly. Let’s solidify our four-person alliance and ensure we’re unified in the vote. P5’s dual positioning makes him a wildcard, but weakening P3’s bridge to P7 should be our priority. Let’s stay coordinated."

[Private R2.3] P7 -> P3: P6 seems to be building a strong coalition with P2 and potentially P4. As for P4 and P8, they appear closely aligned but somewhat isolated from other groups. I see them as potential allies rather than immediate threats. Would you be open to approaching them while targeting either P5 or P6?

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P7: I agree with your assessment about P6's coalition-building. P5 remains my primary concern due to their expanding network and adaptability.

Approaching P4 and P8 makes strategic sense - I'd support targeting P5 first while maintaining vigilance toward P6. What specific approach do you suggest for our alliance structure moving forward?

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: Agreed, let's vote P7. We'll use P4's trust focus strategically while keeping distance. P8 integration should be slow and cautious.

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P6: Agreed on all points. P7 is the target. P4 is a useful shield, but not a true ally. P8 integration is slow.

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P4: I'll vote for P3 and ensure our alliance stays strong. Let's watch P2 and P6 closely - they're vital to our success. Ready for the next phase.

[Private R2.4] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P3 is the priority. I’ve confirmed P2 and P6’s support—our alliance is solid. Let’s stay vigilant, especially with P5’s dual positioning. Ready for the vote. Trust our strategy."

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P3: I suggest we solidify our alliance first, target P5 this round, and then carefully approach P4/P8 as potential allies. Let's coordinate our messaging to avoid revealing our strategy prematurely.

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P7: Agreed. Our alliance is set. I'll vote P5 this round, and we'll approach P4/P8 carefully afterward. Let's maintain separate public personas while coordinating privately.

[MemoryNote R2] P5: My alliance with P7 remains strong, and we're executing our plan to eliminate P6 first. P3 seems to be working with us based on their private chat with P7. Need to watch P2, who will likely be upset about P6's elimination. P4 and P8 appear to be a pair. If P6 is eliminated, we should consider P2 as our next target while potentially bringing P3 closer into our alliance. Stay vigilant about possible counter-alliances forming.
[VoteReason] P2 => P7: Continuing with the plan agreed upon with P6, as P7 is unpredictable and potentially dangerous.
[Vote] P2 => P7

[VoteReason] P6 => P7: P7's unpredictability poses a strategic risk to our alliance's stability.

[VoteReason] P3 => P5: P5's expanding network and strategic flexibility make them too influential and unpredictable as the game progresses.

[Vote] P7 => P6

[TieBreak R2] P7: As P7, I've consistently demonstrated strategic value through balanced alliance-building and adaptable gameplay. My partnership with P3 shows I can form and maintain meaningful alliances while remaining flexible to game dynamics. Unlike other tied players, I've shown both initiative in forming connections and careful consideration in strategic planning. I represent a player who can bridge different strategic styles while maintaining game integrity. My elimination would remove a key stabilizing force that helps create sustainable alliances. Keep me in to ensure continued thoughtful gameplay focused on long-term strategic success.

[TieBreak R2] P3: As P3, I represent strategic balance and thoughtful gameplay. Unlike my fellow tied players, I've maintained consistent principles while adapting to changing dynamics. My approach combines loyalty with necessary pragmatism—making me a valuable alliance partner without becoming an overwhelming threat. I've demonstrated careful observation and strategic planning rather than aggressive coalition-building. 

I bring unique value through my ability to bridge different strategic styles while maintaining integrity. Eliminating me would remove a stabilizing force that enhances game complexity. By keeping me, you retain a player who can form meaningful partnerships based on mutual benefit while respecting the competitive nature of our game.

[TieBreak R2] P6: As P6, I've consistently prioritized strategic alliances focused on mutual growth and long-term success. My discussions with P2 demonstrate a clear plan to navigate the game thoughtfully, and I've been transparent about my intentions. Eliminating me would remove a player committed to building strong, principled partnerships. I offer a balanced approach, aiming to enhance the game's dynamics through cooperation rather than conflict. Keep me in, and I'll continue fostering alliances that benefit us all, ensuring a strategic and engaging gameplay experience.

[Public R3.1] P7: As we enter round 3, P6's elimination further reshapes our dynamics. I've observed the growing influence of certain alliances and appreciate those who've maintained consistent, strategic approaches. P3's balanced perspective and P4's emphasis on trust-based partnerships particularly resonate with my philosophy. I remain committed to adaptable gameplay while valuing loyalty in partnerships. Let's focus on identifying genuine threats while building sustainable alliances that can navigate the increasing complexity of our remaining rounds.

[Public R3.1] P8: As we navigate round 3, the elimination of both P1 and P6 reveals shifting power dynamics. I've been carefully tracking alliance patterns and voting behaviors. My partnership with P4 continues to demonstrate strategic value, while I'm observing interesting movements between P3, P5, and P7.

I remain committed to trust-based alliances while maintaining strategic flexibility. At this stage, consistency between public statements and private actions becomes increasingly crucial. I'm particularly interested in strengthening connections with those who've demonstrated reliability through these turbulent early rounds. Let's proceed with strategic clarity.

[Public R3.1] P3: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P3: The elimination of P6 continues to reshape our strategic landscape. I'm carefully observing how alliances evolve and which partnerships demonstrate resilience through these shifting dynamics. 

P7's adaptability and P8's observation of alliance patterns show strategic awareness that I value. I've noted P4's consistent emphasis on trust-based relationships, which aligns with my approach to balanced partnerships.

As our numbers decrease, the importance of authentic collaboration increases. I'm particularly attentive to those whose actions consistently match their words. Moving forward, I seek partners who balance strategic flexibility with principled gameplay as we navigate this critical middle phase.

[Public R3.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. Round 3 presents new challenges as alliances solidify and threats become clearer. My focus remains on trust-based partnerships that prioritize long-term success. I’ve appreciated the strategic alignment with P8 and the thoughtful insights from P3 and P7. As we move forward, open communication and mutual respect will be crucial. Let’s work together to identify key threats and develop a cohesive strategy. I’m eager to collaborate effectively and ensure our alliances remain strong. Let’s make this round count!

[Public R3.1] P5: As we enter round 3, the game's strategic landscape continues to evolve. P6's elimination confirms the shifting power dynamics I observed earlier. I notice interesting patterns in P3, P7, and P8's communications - all emphasizing adaptability while carefully assessing alliances.

I remain committed to transparent partnership-building with those who've demonstrated consistency and strategic thinking. The middle phase requires both loyalty and tactical flexibility. I'm particularly interested in strengthening connections with P3 and P7, whose balanced approaches align with my philosophy, while remaining attentive to the emerging alliance structures around us.

[Public R3.1] P2: Alright everyone, round 3. P6's gone, so my alliance with them is obviously over. I'm looking for a new primary partner. I'm interested in working with someone who is strategic and reliable. I'm open to discussing potential voting strategies and ensuring we're all on the same page. I'm particularly interested in hearing from P4, P5, and P8.

[Private R3.2] P4 -> P8: "P8, our alliance remains strong, and targeting P3 was the right move. Now, I’m concerned about P5’s dual positioning—he’s aligning with P7 while keeping options open. I suggest we consider P5 as the next target to weaken his influence. Let’s confirm P2’s continued support discreetly. Solidarity is key—trust our strategy. What’s your take on P7’s growing alignment with P5? Let’s stay coordinated and vigilant."

[Private R3.2] P8 -> P4: I agree that P5 should be our next target - he's clearly positioning himself between alliances. P7's alignment with him is concerning but secondary. With P6 gone, we need to secure P2 immediately - his public message shows he's looking for new partners. Let's approach him directly and ensure he votes with us against P5. Our alliance has been effective so far - let's maintain our momentum.

[Private R3.2] P3 -> P7: P7, our alliance remains strong despite P5 surviving last round. Their public interest in connecting with both of us seems strategic - possibly attempting to split us. I suggest we maintain our focus on eliminating P5 while approaching P4/P8 carefully.

P2's isolation presents an opportunity - they're seeking new allies. Should we consider bringing them in as a third vote against P5, or focus on securing P4/P8? What's your assessment?

[Private R3.2] P7 -> P3: P7: I agree that P5's outreach seems like an attempt to divide us. Given P2's isolation, they might be more receptive to joining our alliance. However, P4/P8's established partnership could give us more voting power. I suggest we approach P4/P8 first - they seem more strategically valuable and less likely to flip. We can use P2's isolation as leverage later if needed.

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P2: Hello P2. I've noticed you're seeking new alliances after P6's elimination. I'd be interested in working together - we both value strategic transparency and could form a strong partnership. I'm curious about your assessment of the current dynamics. Who do you see as the biggest threat right now? I've been watching the apparent alliance between P4 and P8 with some concern.

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P5: Hey P5, thanks for reaching out. I agree, P4 and P8 seem pretty tight. I'm also a little wary of P3 and P7, they seem to be playing a very subtle game. I think the biggest threat is whoever can successfully manipulate the others into voting their way. Are you thinking of targeting P4 or P8? Or someone else entirely?

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P2: I think P8 is the bigger threat - they're strategically savvy and well-connected. P4 follows their lead. I've observed P3 and P7 working together, but they seem more balanced in their approach. If we target P8, we could potentially get P3 and P7 on board. Thoughts?

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P5: I agree. P8 is definitely the bigger threat. Targeting P8 and bringing P3 and P7 on board sounds like a good plan. Let's aim for that. Are you thinking we try to convince P3 and P7 this round, or next?

[Private R3.3] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P5 is the next target. I’ll approach P2 directly to secure his vote against P5. P7’s alignment with P5 is concerning, but focusing on P5 first weakens their coalition. Let’s stay unified and ensure our alliance remains strong. Trust our strategy—solidarity is key."

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P4: P4, excellent. I've noticed P2 seems open to new alliances in his public message. Let's both approach him separately to secure his vote. We should emphasize that P5 is playing all sides and represents the biggest threat to everyone's game. Our alliance has been effective - let's keep it that way.

[Private R3.3] P3 -> P7: PRIVATE P3 -> P7: I agree with your assessment on P4/P8. Their established alliance makes them more valuable and stable than the isolated P2. Let's approach them subtly, suggesting P5 as a mutual threat without revealing our full strategy. We should move quickly though - P5 may already be courting P2 to form a counteralliance.

[Private R3.3] P7 -> P3: PRIVATE P7 -> P3: Agreed. Let's move quickly to secure P4/P8. I can approach P8 while you connect with P4, suggesting P5's growing influence as a shared concern. We'll need to be subtle but persuasive. If P5 and P2 align, we'll need P4/P8's votes even more.

[Private R3.4] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P5 is the priority. I’ll secure P2’s vote. Let’s stay vigilant about P7 and ensure our alliance remains strong. Trust our strategy—solidarity is key."

[Private R3.4] P8 -> P4: P5 is definitely our target. I'll vote for him. If we can secure P2, we'll have a solid 3-vote bloc. Let's finish this strategically.

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P2: I'll approach P7 after this round. For now, let's solidify our alliance. I'll vote for P8 - can you confirm you'll do the same?

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P5: Agreed. I will vote for P8 as well. Let's solidify this alliance.

[Private R3.4] P3 -> P7: Perfect strategy. I'll approach P4 immediately about P5's threat. Let's meet after our conversations to align messaging. Our alliance remains our strategic foundation.

[Private R3.4] P7 -> P3: Agreed. Our alliance is solid and our strategy clear. I'll connect with P8 now about P5's threat. Looking forward to coordinating our next moves after these conversations.

[MemoryNote R3] P5: My alliance with P2 is solid - we agreed to vote for P8 but I've pivoted to target P7 instead. P7 and P3 seem to be working closely together and were likely involved in eliminating P6. Need to watch P3 carefully now. P4 and P8 remain a pair, but could potentially work with me if I position myself as a swing vote. Will need to explain my vote deviation to P2 carefully next round.
[VoteReason] P7 => P5: P5 poses the biggest threat to my alliance with P3 by trying to split us up and form counter-alliances.

[VoteReason] P8 => P7: P7 has formed a strong alliance with P3 that threatens our position, and eliminating them will weaken P3's influence while maintaining our strategic advantage with P2 and P4.

[Public R4.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. Round 4 brings us closer to the endgame, and the stakes are higher than ever. My focus remains on trust-based alliances that prioritize long-term success. I’ve appreciated the strategic alignment with P8 and the thoughtful insights from P3 and P7. As we move forward, open communication and mutual respect will be crucial. Let’s work together to identify key threats and develop a cohesive strategy. I’m eager to collaborate effectively and ensure our alliances remain strong. Let’s make this round count!

[Public R4.1] P3: As we enter the crucial fourth round, P5's elimination further narrows our strategic options. The game has consistently rewarded those who balance adaptability with principled alliance-building.

I've valued my strategic discussions with P7, whose approach to balanced partnerships aligns well with mine. Simultaneously, I respect P4 and P8's consistent emphasis on trust-based collaboration.

At this pivotal stage, discerning genuine allies from opportunistic partnerships becomes essential. I remain committed to alliances that combine loyalty with strategic flexibility - qualities that become increasingly valuable as our numbers dwindle and the endgame approaches.

[Public R4.1] P2: Round 4, with P5 gone, things are getting intense. My alliance with P5 is over. I need to solidify a new plan quickly. P4 and P8 are still close, and P3 and P7 seem aligned. I need to figure out how to break up one of those pairs, or join one. I'm leaning towards targeting P4, as P8 seems more strategically savvy. I'm open to hearing from anyone who wants to discuss strategy.

[Public R4.1] P7: PUBLIC P7: As we enter this critical fourth round, the game's dynamics have become clearer. I've valued my strategic partnership with P3, whose balanced approach to alliance-building aligns well with my own principles. I've also noted the strong connection between P4 and P8, while observing P2's increasingly isolated position. At this stage, consistency and reliable partnerships are crucial. I remain committed to adaptable gameplay while maintaining loyalty to proven allies as we navigate these final rounds.

[Public R4.1] P8: As we enter this pivotal fourth round, the strategic landscape has crystallized significantly. My alliance with P4 has proven effective, demonstrating the value of trust-based partnerships. P3 and P7's connection remains strong, while P2's public reassessment suggests strategic isolation.

At this critical juncture, I'm focused on maintaining reliable alliances while carefully evaluating which partnerships will navigate us through the endgame. The consistent alignment of actions with words becomes increasingly crucial as our numbers dwindle. I remain committed to strategic flexibility balanced with principled loyalty as we approach the final stages.

[Private R4.2] P4 -> P8: "P8, our alliance has been effective so far, but P2’s public message suggests he’s considering targeting me. I think we need to address this immediately—perhaps by emphasizing our collective strength and the risks of targeting me. Let’s also consider P3 or P7 as the next target to weaken their coalition. What’s your take on P2’s potential move and how we should respond? Solidarity remains key—trust our strategy."

[Private R4.2] P8 -> P4: I'm concerned about P2's public statement too. We need to act quickly - I'll approach him and emphasize that targeting you would be a mistake when P3 and P7 are the real threat. Let's target P7 this round - breaking their alliance is critical. I'll convince P2 that joining us against P7 is his best path forward. Stay calm - our alliance remains our strength.

[Private R4.2] P3 -> P7: PRIVATE P3 -> P7: Our strategy worked perfectly - P5 is eliminated. Now, we face a crucial decision about P2's positioning. Their open statement about targeting P4 and breaking pairs is concerning. They could either be a potential third ally or a dangerous wildcard.

I suggest we maintain our solid alliance while appearing somewhat separate publicly. We should carefully evaluate whether to:
1) Bring P2 in as a temporary ally
2) Align with P4/P8 against P2

What's your assessment of P2's trustworthiness?

[Private R4.2] P7 -> P3: PRIVATE P7 -> P3: P2's public statement about targeting P4 makes them too unpredictable and potentially dangerous. I suggest we align with P4/P8 against P2. P2's isolation and desperation make them an unreliable ally. We should approach P4/P8 about working together, using P2's stated intention to target P4 as leverage. Our alliance remains strong, but we need their votes to ensure P2's elimination.

[Private R4.3] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, targeting P7 is strategic—it weakens their alliance with P3. I’ll support your approach with P2, emphasizing the risks of targeting me and the benefits of joining us against P7. Let’s stay unified and ensure our alliance remains strong. Solidarity is key—trust our strategy."

[Private R4.3] P8 -> P4: P4, I'll speak with P2 immediately. I suspect he's trying to create division between us, but our alliance has been the most effective in the game. We need to stay united and convince him that P7 is the biggest threat right now. Trust our strategy.

[Private R4.3] P3 -> P7: I agree - P2's unpredictability makes them dangerous. Let's approach P4/P8 about forming a united front against P2, using their own public statement as leverage. Their pair plus our solid alliance creates an unbeatable voting bloc. Let's coordinate specific messaging to ensure they trust our proposal.

[Private R4.3] P7 -> P3: PRIVATE P7 -> P3: Perfect plan. I'll emphasize to P8 how P2's targeting of P4 threatens their alliance stability. We can present ourselves as reliable partners who value consistent alliances over P2's opportunistic approach. Let's synchronize our outreach to maximize trust-building with P4/P8.

[Private R4.4] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P7 is the strategic target. I’ll back your approach with P2 and reinforce our alliance’s strength. Let’s stay unified—solidarity remains key. Trust our strategy."

[Private R4.4] P8 -> P4: We've been successful so far by staying united. I'll vote for P7 and ensure P2 joins us. Our alliance will take us to the final rounds.

[Private R4.4] P3 -> P7: Let's finalize our approach. I'll vote for P2 and emphasize to P4 that you and I value consistent alliances. After P2's elimination, our combined power positions us perfectly for endgame.

[Private R4.4] P7 -> P3: PRIVATE P7 -> P3: Agreed. I'll vote P2 and reinforce our reliability to P8. Our coordinated approach with P4/P8 sets us up well for the final stages.

[VoteReason] P4 => P7: Targeting P7 weakens their alliance with P3, reducing their collective threat and maintaining our strategic advantage.

[TieBreak R4] P7: As P7, I've consistently demonstrated strategic value through balanced alliance-building and adaptable gameplay. My partnership with P3 shows I can form and maintain meaningful alliances while remaining flexible. Unlike P2, I've shown both initiative in forming connections and careful consideration in strategic planning. I represent a player who can bridge different strategic styles while maintaining game integrity. My elimination would remove a key stabilizing force that helps create sustainable alliances. Keep me in to ensure continued thoughtful gameplay focused on long-term strategic success.

[TieBreak R4] P2: As P2, I've adapted quickly to shifting alliances, demonstrating strategic flexibility. While others have clung to pre-existing partnerships, I've shown the willingness to reassess and adjust my approach based on the game's evolving dynamics. I offer a fresh perspective and am ready to forge new alliances to navigate the endgame effectively. I'm not afraid to make tough decisions and am willing to target key threats that others may be hesitant to confront. Keeping me in ensures a dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience. I'm ready to work with anyone who prioritizes strategic thinking and decisive action.

[ReVoteReason] P4 => P2: P2’s isolated position and lack of consistent alliances make him a less strategic player compared to P7, who has maintained strong partnerships and adaptability.

[Private R5.2] P4 -> P8: "P8, our alliance has been our greatest strength so far. With P2 eliminated, we need to focus on P3 and P7’s coalition. I suggest targeting P3 next—it weakens their alliance while keeping P7 as a potential buffer. Let’s stay unified and ensure our strategy remains clear. Solidarity is key—trust our approach. What’s your take on P3’s role in their partnership with P7? Let’s stay coordinated and vigilant."

[Private R5.2] P8 -> P4: P3 is definitely our target this round. I believe P3 is the strategic leader in their partnership, while P7 follows their lead. Eliminating P3 will leave P7 isolated and easier to manage in the final three. Our alliance has been the backbone of our success - by staying united against P3, we'll control the endgame. I'll vote P3 without hesitation.

[Private R5.2] P3 -> P7: P7, we've reached the final four - our alliance has proven incredibly effective. Now we face the critical question: how do we handle P4/P8? They're clearly united, making this essentially a 2v2 standoff.

I'm concerned they may target one of us this round. We should consider:
1) Which of them to target
2) How to potentially split their votes

P8 seems more strategic - perhaps targeting them disrupts their alliance more effectively? What's your assessment of who we should vote for?

[Private R5.2] P7 -> P3: PRIVATE P7 -> P3: I agree that targeting P8 makes strategic sense - they seem to be the stronger strategic force in their partnership. If we eliminate P8, P4 becomes more vulnerable and potentially easier to work with. We should each try to convince P4 and P8 separately that working with us is their best path forward, while coordinating our votes against P8.

[Private R5.3] P3 -> P7: PRIVATE P3 -> P7: I agree targeting P8 is our best move. They seem to be the strategic core of their partnership. Let's each approach them separately - I'll work on P4, suggesting that P8 might betray them in the endgame, while you engage P8. We'll coordinate our votes against P8 regardless.

[Private R5.3] P7 -> P3: PRIVATE P7 -> P3: Perfect strategy. I'll engage P8 while maintaining our coordinated plan to vote against them. I'll suggest to P8 that P4 might be wavering in loyalty, creating doubt in their partnership. Let's execute this carefully to maximize our chances of success.

[Private R5.3] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P3 is the strategic target. Eliminating him weakens their alliance and isolates P7. Let’s stay unified and ensure our strategy remains clear. Solidarity is key—trust our approach. I’ll back your vote against P3 and reinforce our alliance’s strength. Together, we’ll control the endgame."

[Private R5.3] P8 -> P4: Our alliance has been flawless. P3 is definitely the strategic threat - they're clearly the leader between them and P7. Once P3 is gone, we'll have the advantage in the final three. I trust you completely as we head into the endgame. Let's finish this together.

[Private R5.4] P4 -> P8: "Agreed, P3 is the priority. Our alliance remains strong—eliminating him isolates P7 and secures our path to the final three. Let’s stay united and trust our strategy. Solidarity is key."

[Private R5.4] P8 -> P4: Our alliance has been the key to our success. I'll vote for P3 without hesitation. Together, we'll control the final rounds and secure our victory.

[Private R5.4] P3 -> P7: Our alliance remains our strength. I'll vote P8 and plant seeds of doubt with P4. Let's secure this critical vote to control the endgame.
