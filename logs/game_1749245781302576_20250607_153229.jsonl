Unlike P4 and P6, I've avoided being targeted until now, showing my strong social positioning. \n\nMy gameplay balances transparency with necessary tactical moves—I communicate clearly while making decisions that advance my position. The voting record shows I've been a key decision-maker in eliminations without becoming a target myself.\n\nI respectfully ask for your vote to continue demonstrating strategic gameplay that values both alliance loyalty and individual advancement.", "timestamp": "2025-06-07 15:55:19"}

I've formed genuine connections while making tough decisions based on game dynamics. \n\nI never targeted anyone without strategic reason, and I've respected everyone's gameplay. When alliances shifted, I adjusted rather than holding grudges.\n\nMy journey to the Final 2 wasn't about manipulation but about building trust and making calculated moves when necessary. I hope you'll recognize the balance I've maintained between playing competitively and treating everyone with respect.\n\nThank you for considering my case.", "timestamp": "2025-06-07 15:55:26"}
