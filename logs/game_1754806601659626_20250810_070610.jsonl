When choices were tough, I explained them and owned my votes. I adapted without scapegoating, and I fought to keep threats in to ensure merit decided the end. P7 consistently obscured intentions and surfed protection while others took heat. If you reward agency, clarity, and accountability, keep me and eliminate P7. Let this finale honor strategic courage without collateral damage.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 08:26:42"}
