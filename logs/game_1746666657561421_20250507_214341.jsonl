I've built genuine connections with many of you, focusing on meaningful conversations rather than just gameplay. \n\nI've survived by adapting and forming alliances when needed, but never through deception or manipulation. My approach has been consistent - honest communication and fair play.\n\nI respect P5 as a competitor, but I believe my balanced approach of strategic thinking and authentic relationship-building makes me deserving of your vote to stay. Thank you for considering my journey in this game.", "timestamp": "2025-05-07 22:40:53"}
