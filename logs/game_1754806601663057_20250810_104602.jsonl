Throughout, I was transparent, took risks, and owned every vote. I made plans openly, protected allies when I could, and when I had to cut, I told people to their face. P4 consistently stayed reactive and hid behind others’ moves; when it mattered, they overpromised and ghosted. Reward agency and accountability over passivity. If you valued straight talk, strategy you could track, and respect for your time, crown P1 by voting P4 out.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 13:34:57"}

I'm here because I earned it—through loyalty and adaptability. Vote to keep me, and I'll prove this win is deserved. Let’s honor a game well played, not won by chaos.
