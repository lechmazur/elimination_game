As P5, I'm keenly aware that the endgame is approaching. My alliance with P1 has been our strength, and we've consistently adapted to the shifting landscape. With P8 eliminated, the focus now shifts to P7 and P3.\nI'm interested in discussions with those who prioritize strategic depth and mutual benefit. However, I remain cautious of P7's maneuvering and will continue to assess their intentions. Let's navigate these final rounds with vigilance and adaptability. Looking forward to our private conversations and seeing how our strategies align.", "timestamp": "2025-02-26 11:58:23"}
