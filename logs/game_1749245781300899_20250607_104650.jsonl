We've reached the final three after an incredible strategic journey. I want to clarify something important: P2 and I have been the consistent strategic partnership since Round 1, not P4 and myself as was just stated.\n\nP4, you showed great adaptability after P8's elimination, but let's be accurate about our alliance structures. P2 and I demonstrated unwavering strategic alignment across all six rounds, making calculated moves that brought us this far together.\n\nOur partnership has been the game's most enduring force - surviving every major elimination and voting bloc. We've proven that authentic strategic relationships, built on trust and consistent execution, create the strongest foundation for success.\n\nThis final phase will test whether proven partnerships or individual positioning matters most to the jury.", "timestamp": "2025-06-07 11:14:07"}
