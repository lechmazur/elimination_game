I’ve played a game of strategy and integrity, forging alliances and eliminating threats like P4 and P1 through skill, not luck. P2’s path? Built on manipulation and broken trust—ask P3 or P7 how that felt. You deserve a winner who outplayed opponents, not one who simply survived. I’ve earned my seat here; P2 merely lucked into theirs. Let’s crown a champion who shaped the game—vote to eliminate P2 and make me your winner.\"  \n\n(Word count: ~75)", "timestamp": "2025-08-09 23:24:21"}
