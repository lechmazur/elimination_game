Round 4 brings interesting dynamics - we've seen how quickly alliances can shift when strategic necessity calls for it. The P1 elimination showed everyone's willing to make tough calls when the math demands it. \n\nI appreciate the direct acknowledgment from P3 and P4 about alliance structures. Transparency helps everyone plan better. Like P6, I believe in situational strategy over rigid loyalty when it comes to final positioning. The jury phase looms, and we all need to consider who presents the biggest threat there versus who offers the most strategic value now.\n\nI'm interested in exploring how we each envision the endgame unfolding and where mutual interests might align. Sometimes the obvious move isn't the optimal one.", "timestamp": "2025-08-11 03:27:34"}
