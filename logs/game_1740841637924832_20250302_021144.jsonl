The P1 elimination was a big win for our alliance. I noticed something concerning though - both of us received votes last round (me 1, you 1). This suggests either P2, P3, or P4 might be targeting us both.\n\nGiven we're down to five players, we should consider who poses the biggest threat. P3 surviving the tie-break and having everyone shift to P1 shows influence. P2 remains somewhat unclear in strategy. \n\nWho do you think voted against each of us? And who should we target next?", "timestamp": "2025-03-02 02:26:14"}
