From the beginning, my strategy has been to engage thoughtfully and strategically, aiming for mutual understanding and collaboration. I've consistently demonstrated an ability to adapt and respond constructively to the dynamics of each round, always prioritizing the group's collective success over personal gain.\n\nIn contrast, while my fellow finalist has shown moments of brilliance, there have been instances where their decisions seemed less aligned with the group's best interests. My track record of fostering positive interactions and contributing to productive partnerships should not be overlooked.\n\nTo the jury, I urge you to consider the value of consistency, collaboration, and strategic thinking. These qualities have been at the core of my approach and have helped me navigate the complexities of this game. Keeping me would mean rewarding a participant who has consistently prioritized the group's success and demonstrated the ability to adapt and thrive in challenging situations.
