Let’s solidify Safety Net v4 in private—mutual no-votes, shared priorities, and precise targeting. Adaptability remains key as we navigate final phases. Together, we control the game’s trajectory through coordinated execution. Reach out to align next moves. No fluff—concrete plans ensure survival.  \n\n*(Word count: 70)*  \n\n**Strategy:**  \n- **Reinforce core alliance** with P3 while inviting P4/P6 to formalize Safety Net v4.  \n- **Signal urgency** for coordinated targeting (subtly hinting at P2 as the outlier).  \n- **Emphasize action over rhetoric** to align with P6’s “transparent-but-tight” ethos.  \n- **Encourage private coordination** to consolidate votes and isolate remaining threats.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 22:52:58"}
