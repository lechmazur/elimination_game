I never voted against any of you until it was unavoidable; when I did, I was upfront, not sneaky. I shepherded shifting majorities that protected many of you for extra rounds, and I never broke a promise. P5 coasted behind shields I created, then cut allies at first opportunity. Reward transparent, strategic, yet loyal play over passive opportunism. Keep the player who respected your agency—eliminate P5 and let integrity win.", "timestamp": "2025-05-08 07:32:20"}
