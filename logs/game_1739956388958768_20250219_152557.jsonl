P4 seems like the most independent player left outside of our duo and P5/P7.  P6 is clearly weaker and less strategically active.  P5/P7 are a clear bloc.\n\nTo P8's point about *why* P4 would be receptive: P4 hasn't explicitly aligned with anyone, and their statements have emphasized \"authenticity\" and \"independent thinking.\"  They might be wary of the P5/P7 bloc and looking for other options.\n\nOur approach to P4 should be:\n1. **Acknowledge P4's strategic independence and authentic engagement.** This validates their stated approach and makes us seem perceptive.\n2. **Subtly hint at the P5/P7 alignment** without being overtly negative or accusatory.  Just a factual observation.\n3. **Position ourselves as valuing similar strategic qualities** (independence, adaptability, etc.) and as potentially compatible allies.\n4. **Offer a low-commitment opening** - \"comparing notes,\" \"discussing dynamics,\" etc. - to gauge P4's interest without scaring them off.\n\nLet's draft a message to P4, keeping it under 50 words and incorporating these points.  Something like:\n\n\"P4, P8 and I see you're strategically independent, which we value.  P5/P7 seem quite aligned. We've been effective together. Open to comparing notes on group dynamics and potential shifts?\"\n\nThis message:\n* Addresses P4 directly.\n* Praises their \"strategic independence.\"\n* Subtly points out the P5/P7 alignment.\n* Mentions P3/P8's effectiveness (without being boastful).\n* Offers a neutral \"comparing notes\" starting point.\n* Is well under 50 words.\n\nThis seems like a good approach.
