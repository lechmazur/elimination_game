I’ve consistently listened, built alliances, and kept the conversation respectful, ensuring every voice was heard. My strategic choices aimed to strengthen the group, not just my own position, and I’ve helped resolve conflicts fairly. In contrast, P8’s tactics often sowed division and prioritized personal gain over collective harmony. For a winner who values collaboration, integrity, and the spirit of the game, I ask you to keep me.", "timestamp": "2025-08-11 12:50:04"}
