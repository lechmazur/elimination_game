I've built genuine connections with many of you while playing a balanced game that respected everyone's position. \n\nI never targeted anyone out of spite or formed exclusionary alliances. Instead, I adapted my strategy as the game evolved, making difficult decisions based on gameplay rather than personal vendettas.\n\nIf you value someone who played with integrity while still making strategic moves to advance, I'd be honored to have your vote. Thank you all for the fascinating journey we've shared.", "timestamp": "2025-04-21 12:01:00"}
