P7's elimination clearly demonstrated the strength of the P5/P8 bond. My game has been about consistent strategy and demonstrable reliability, adapting as needed. While P5 and P8 have worked closely, the final vote comes down to individual choices and who you trust most sitting beside you at the end. The private chats will be decisive in figuring out the best path forward for each of us. Let's play this final stage out strategically. Good luck.", "timestamp": "2025-03-27 14:37:26"}
