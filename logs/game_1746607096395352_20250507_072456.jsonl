My high vote count reflects past targeting, not poor strategy—I've shown strong adaptability, building trust and alliances with P5 and P3 through consistent, collaborative actions. Eliminating me disrupts this balance; P3's zero exposure makes them a stealthy threat with jury appeal. Let's prioritize strategic foresight and mutual respect.
