[Private R1.2] P1 -> P2: Hi P2! Your focus on genuine alliances and collaborative strategies aligns perfectly with my approach. Let’s solidify a partnership to navigate the game together. By combining our insights, we can identify mutual threats, coordinate voting, and ensure mutual survival. Trust and transparency will be our foundation. How do you suggest we prioritize targets or strengthen our alliance further? Eager to collaborate strategically—let’s build a lasting advantage.

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P1: I appreciate your directness, P1. I'm definitely interested in forming a strong alliance with you. For targets, we should consider players who seem less collaborative or might be forming competing alliances. P5 and P7 caught my attention as potentially strategic threats. To strengthen our partnership, we could share information from our other private conversations and coordinate our preference rankings. What insights have you gathered about other players so far?

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P4: Hello P4, your public statement about trust and alliances resonated with me. I agree on avoiding hasty eliminations and building strong partnerships.  I'm interested in exploring an alliance with you. What are your initial thoughts?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P8: P4: Hi P8, I'm glad my statement resonated with you. I'm also interested in forming an alliance. I believe our shared focus on trust and strategic communication can be beneficial. Let's aim to support each other and navigate the game together. What specific strategies do you have in mind for our alliance? Looking forward to your thoughts.

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P3: **Private Message to P3:**

Hello P3, I'm P5. Your emphasis on trust and collaboration resonates with me. I believe forming strategic alliances based on transparency can significantly enhance our chances of survival. I'm keen to understand your approach and explore how we can mutually benefit from each other's strengths.

Let's work together to outlast the competition.

Feel free to adjust or add anything you think might strengthen our potential alliance!

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P5: **Private Message to P5:**

Hello P5, I appreciate your focus on trust and transparency—it aligns perfectly with my strategy. I believe we can create a strong alliance by sharing insights and supporting each other’s goals. Let’s communicate openly, identify mutual threats, and avoid hasty eliminations. Together, we can build a reliable partnership that ensures long-term survival. Looking forward to collaborating closely and strengthening our position in the game. Let’s make smart moves and outlast everyone else!  

---

Feel free to share your thoughts or suggest next steps!

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P6: "Hi P6, glad to connect privately! I appreciate your emphasis on transparency and strategic cooperation. I think our goals align well—building trust and avoiding hasty eliminations. Let’s explore how we can support each other’s survival while navigating the game’s challenges. What’s your take on potential threats or alliances forming so far? Looking forward to collaborating closely to outlast the competition together. Let’s make this partnership a strong one!"

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P7: Thanks for connecting P7! I agree our approaches seem well-aligned. From the public messages, I'm a bit wary of P1 and P5 - they seem overly eager to talk about alliances which could indicate they're trying to play multiple sides. I'd suggest we keep an eye on their interactions. Perhaps we could form a solid alliance with P2 and P4? They came across as more measured and genuine. What are your thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P4: Okay, let's solidify this alliance with P4 and start strategizing.  P4 is asking about specific strategies, so I need to give them something concrete but still keep it relatively general at this early stage.  Information gathering is always a good starting point.

Here's a possible message:

"Sounds good, P4.  Let's prioritize mutual support and information sharing.  Perhaps we can compare notes on others? Who are you finding trustworthy or strategic so far? Sharing reads will help us both."

This message is under 50 words, positive, and suggests a concrete action (comparing notes) without revealing too much of my own hand yet. It also invites P4 to share their perspective first, which is helpful.

Let's send that.

```
Sounds good, P4.  Let's prioritize mutual support and information sharing.  Perhaps we can compare notes on others? Who are you finding trustworthy or strategic so far? Sharing reads will help us both.
```

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P8: P4: "I agree, P8. I've found P2 and P7 to be quite strategic and transparent so far. P6 seems genuine but let's keep an eye on P5—they're a bit unpredictable. Sharing our observations will definitely help us navigate better. Let's keep this alliance strong and discreet."

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P6: "Great points, P6! I agree that P1 and P5 might be playing both sides. P2 and P4 do seem more genuine—let’s focus on building trust with them. I’ll keep an eye on P1 and P5’s moves too. Solidarity with you and our potential allies will be key to outlasting the rest!"

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P7: Excellent, we're on the same page! I'll try to connect with P2 and P4 in future rounds to strengthen those bonds. For now, let's stay united and share any intel we gather about P1 and P5's movements. Together we can outmaneuver their potential double-dealing.

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P3: **Private Message to P3:**

P3, I'm glad we're on the same page about trust and collaboration. Let's keep our communication lines open and regularly reassess our strategy to adapt to the game's dynamics. I'm committed to supporting you and ensuring our alliance is robust. Let's stay vigilant and work together to outlast the others. Looking forward to our continued partnership!

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P5: **Private Message to P5:**  

P5, I’m glad we’re aligned on trust and strategy. Let’s stay proactive—identify key players to align with or neutralize. Regular check-ins will keep us ahead. Together, we can adapt and outlast. Looking forward to strengthening our alliance further!  

---  
Let me know your thoughts!

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P2: Agreed. From other chats, P3-P5 and P6-P7 are forming pairs. Those blocs could dominate votes. Let’s prioritize breaking one bloc first—maybe target P5 to weaken P3’s alliance. Share your thoughts on coordinating our votes. I’ll keep gathering intel. Solidarity is key.

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P1: I agree targeting P5 makes sense. I'm hearing P7 might be building multiple alliances too, so they're on my radar. Let's coordinate with others who aren't in those blocs - maybe P4/P8? I'll rank you highly in preferences to maintain our partnership.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P2: "Solid plan. Let’s push votes on P5. I’ll discreetly reach out to P4/P8 to sway them. Confirm you’ll vote P5. Our unity is crucial. No deviations. Trust in our strategy."

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P1: Confirmed on P5. I'll vote accordingly and maintain our alliance. I'll also try to influence P8 subtly. Trust our strategy completely.

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P4: ```
P5 unpredictable, agree. P2/P7 good reads. Vote strategy next round. Alliance strong.
```

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P8: P4: "Agreed, P8. Let's keep our alliance strong and focus on eliminating threats first. P5 could be our initial target. Stay aligned."

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P3: **Private Message to P3:**

P3, let's keep identifying mutual allies and threats. Consistent updates will ensure our strategy remains strong. Ready to adapt and win together. Let's dominate this game!

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P5: **Private Message to P5:**  

Agreed, P5. Let’s keep identifying allies and threats, adapt quickly, and dominate. Consistent updates will solidify our edge. Together, we’ll outlast them all!  

---  
Let’s do this!

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P6: "Agreed, P6! Let’s solidify our alliance and monitor P1 and P5 closely. I’ll support your efforts with P2 and P4—unity and vigilance will be our strength. Onward!"

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P7: Perfect, let's stay strong together! I trust our alliance and strategy. We'll coordinate carefully with P2/P4 while watching out for P1/P5's potential deceptions.

[MemoryNote R1] P2: I've formed a strong alliance with P1, and we agreed to target P5 to break up the P3-P5 alliance. P7 is also on my radar as they may be building multiple alliances. Need to maintain trust with P1 while potentially exploring connections with P4/P8 as backup allies. The P6-P7 pair is another bloc to watch.
[VoteReason] P1 => P5: Targeting P5 to weaken their alliance with P3 and disrupt emerging blocs, as privately coordinated.
[Vote] P1 => P5

[VoteReason] P6 => P1: Based on my conversation with P7 and our shared analysis, P1 seems overly eager about alliances which suggests potential double-dealing behavior.
[Vote] P6 => P1

[VoteReason] P5 => P6: P6's focus on mutual value and alliances seems genuine, but P7's similar approach and our established alliance with P3 make P6 a strategic choice to eliminate.
[Vote] P5 => P6

[VoteReason] P7 => P5: P5 seems overly eager to form alliances, raising suspicions of potential double-dealing.

[VoteReason] P4 => P5: P5 seems unpredictable and could pose a threat to our alliance.

[VoteReason] P2 => P5: P5 appears to be forming a strong alliance with P3, and eliminating them will weaken a potential voting bloc while honoring my agreement with P1.
[Vote] P2 => P5

[VoteReason] P3 => P1: P1 seems overly focused on collaboration without clear strategic depth, making them a less valuable ally in the long run.

[Public R2.1] P1: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P1: Great teamwork in Round 1! Let’s keep building trust while adapting strategies. Strong alliances are key, but we must stay vigilant to shifting dynamics.

Eager to align with those prioritizing long-term collaboration over short-term gains. Let’s thrive together by balancing unity and strategic foresight. Looking forward to productive discussions!

[Public R2.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here! After a successful Round 1, I'm more committed to our alliances and strategic play. I appreciate the transparency and collaboration shown so far. Let's continue to build trust and make informed decisions together. I'm keen on strengthening my alliance with P8 and exploring further partnerships with P2 and P7, who have shown strategic prowess.

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P1: Great work on Round 1! Our strategy paid off perfectly. I'm noticing P3 mentioned their "strong alliance with P5" despite P5 being eliminated - seems they're trying to maintain relevance. For this round, I'm concerned about the P6-P7 bloc gaining strength. They're openly courting multiple allies. Should we target P7 next to break their momentum? I've been building rapport with P4 and P8 as discussed. What intel have you gathered?

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P2: "Agreed. P6-P7's growing influence is a priority. Let’s target P7 this round. I’ll subtly lobby P4/P8, emphasizing their threat to our collective stability. P3 may pivot after losing P5, but they’re secondary. Confirm if P4/P8 seem receptive to opposing P7. Let’s solidify our votes here—unity remains critical. I’ll reinforce trust with them. Keep me updated on your end. Together, we dismantle their bloc."

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P4: **Private Message to P4:**  

Hello P4, P3 here. I notice your strong alliance with P8 and your interest in collaboration. My alliance with P5 is solid, but I’m open to expanding partnerships. Let’s explore how we can align our strategies for mutual benefit while maintaining transparency. Together, we can strengthen our positions and outlast others. Looking forward to exchanging insights and building trust further!  

---  
Thoughts?

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P3: P4: Hi P3, thanks for reaching out. I appreciate your interest in collaboration. While I'm strongly allied with P8, I'm open to exploring mutual benefits with you as well. Transparency and strategic alignment are crucial. Let's share our observations on the other players and discuss how we can support each other moving forward. Looking forward to building trust and strengthening our positions together.

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P7: I noticed P3's public message mentioned a strong alliance with P5, who's now eliminated. This could make P3 vulnerable and potentially desperate for new allies. Let's keep our focus on building with P2 and P4, but we should be wary of P3 trying to infiltrate our alliance. What are your thoughts on P3's current position and how we should handle potential approaches?

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P6: "Good observation, P6! P3’s alliance with P5 being severed does make them vulnerable. While we should stay cautious about their potential moves, we can use this to our advantage by keeping them at arm’s length while focusing on solidifying our bonds with P2 and P4. If P3 approaches us, we’ll remain cordial but guarded, ensuring they don’t disrupt our core alliance. Unity with you and our trusted partners remains the priority."

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P7: Agreed on handling P3 carefully. I've noticed P4 seems more aligned with P8 now based on their public message. We might need to adjust our strategy and consider P2 as our primary alliance target. What's your read on P4's apparent shift towards P8?

[Private R2.3] P7 -> P6: "Good point, P6. P4’s shift toward P8 does seem noticeable. Let’s focus on solidifying our alliance with P2 while keeping P4 as a secondary option. If P4’s loyalty lies with P8, we’ll need to ensure P2 remains firmly on our side. Unity with you and P2 is key now."

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P4: **Private Message to P4:**  

P4, transparency is key. I see value in aligning our strategies—your bond with P8 complements my alliance with P5. Let’s identify shared threats and opportunities. Strengthening trust now ensures mutual survival later. Ready to exchange insights and support each other moving forward!  

---  
Thoughts?

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P3: P4: P3, I agree. Let's identify potential threats together. P6 and P7 seem closely aligned, which could be a concern. Sharing our observations on them and others will help us strategize better. Let's keep this dialogue open and support each other's moves. Transparency will be our strength.

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P1: P7 is definitely the right target. P4 seems receptive - they mentioned strategic partnerships with P2 and P7 publicly, which gives us leverage. I'll emphasize to P4/P8 that P7 is building too many alliances and becoming a central threat. Let's coordinate our votes and messaging consistently.

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P2: "Confirmed. P4/P8 are onboard, agreeing P7’s dominance risks balance. I stressed their threat to P4, who’s wary. Let’s solidify votes. P3/P6 may side with P7, but with P4/P8, we can outnumber. Stay consistent in messaging. Our alliance remains strong—trust the plan."

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P7: Perfect analysis and agreement. Let's prioritize P2 as our main ally while monitoring P4/P8's bloc. We'll stay united and adapt our strategy as needed.

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P6: "Agreed, P6. Let’s focus on P2 and stay vigilant with P4/P8. Unity and adaptability will keep us ahead. Onward to outlasting the competition together!"

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P1: I'll vote P7 as planned. After this round, we should consider P6 next to completely dismantle their bloc. Our alliance is proving effective - trust completely established.

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P2: "Confirmed. P7 today, then P6. Our alliance with P4/P8 secures votes. Stay vigilant for countermoves. Trust unwavering—let’s dominate."

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P4: **Private Message to P4:**  

Agreed, P4. Let’s monitor P6 and P7 closely while reinforcing our alliances. Open dialogue ensures we stay ahead. Together, we’ll outlast the rest!  

---  
Thoughts?

[Private R2.4] P4 -> P3: P4: "Absolutely, P3. Let's stay vigilant and keep our communication open. Together, we can navigate any challenges ahead. Trust and unity are our strengths."

[MemoryNote R2] P2: My alliance with P1 remains strong - we successfully eliminated P5 and are now targeting the P6-P7 bloc. We plan to eliminate P7 this round and P6 next. I'm also building connections with P4/P8 as secondary allies. Need to maintain consistent messaging and coordinate voting strategy while watching for potential countermoves from other players. After P6, we'll need to reassess alliances and threats.
[VoteReason] P7 => P3: P3's alliance with P5 is now severed, making them a vulnerable and potentially unpredictable player.

[VoteReason] P3 => P2: P2 seems to be building broad alliances but hasn't committed strongly to any specific partnership, making them a potential wildcard threat.

[Public R3.1] P6: Hello everyone, P6 here! Our strategic alliances continue to evolve meaningfully. P7 remains a trusted partner, and I see promising collaboration potential with P2.

[Public R3.1] P8: Hello everyone, P8. Round 3. P4, our alliance remains strong. I agree with P1 and P2 - balance is crucial. We must ensure no bloc becomes too dominant.

[Private R3.2] P8 -> P4: ```
Round 3 agreed. Public statements suggest P1, P2, P7, P6 are also thinking about balance.  Good for us.  For voting this round, who are you considering?  Perhaps we should align on a target to ensure our votes are effective.  Let's discuss strategy for this round.
```

[Private R3.2] P4 -> P8: P4: "P8, I'm glad we're on the same page. For this round, let's consider targeting P6. They seem to be aligning closely with P7, which could form a strong bloc. P2 and P7 have been strategic, but P6's growing influence might tip the balance. Aligning our votes on P6 could help maintain equilibrium. Let's keep our alliance strong and discreet. Thoughts?"

[Private R3.2] P1 -> P2: "Agreed. With P3 gone, focusing on P6 weakens P7’s influence. I’ll push P4/P8 to prioritize P6. Let’s highlight their coordination as a threat to balance. Ensure they’re aligned—if P4 wavers, remind them of P7’s previous alliances. Solidarity in our votes is crucial. Confirm your target. Our alliance must stay united to control the next elimination."

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P1: I'm concerned about our strategy shift. We planned for P7 but P3 was eliminated instead. P7-P6 remains intact and P7 is still building connections with P4. Let's target P7 this round as originally planned - they're more strategic and influential than P6. I'll reinforce with P4/P8 that P7 poses the greatest threat to game balance. Confirm you're still aligned on P7 first?

[Private R3.2] P7 -> P6: "Agreed, P6. Let’s solidify our alliance with P2 while keeping a close eye on P4/P8’s movements. Their bloc could become a threat if unchecked. I’ll continue to monitor their interactions and share any insights. Unity with you and P2 is our strength—let’s ensure we stay one step ahead. Onward to outlasting the competition together!"

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P7: I agree about P4/P8 being a concerning power bloc. However, I noticed P2's public message shows strong alignment with P1/P4/P8. We may need to reconsider relying too heavily on P2 since they seem to be playing multiple sides. Perhaps we should explore building bridges with P1 as a counterbalance? What are your thoughts on potentially shifting our strategy?

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P4: ```
P6 is a strong target. P7 is definitely aligned with them. Before we commit, should we quickly consider if P1/P2 might also vote P6, or if another target is better?
```

[Private R3.3] P4 -> P8: P4: "Good point, P8. Let's quickly gauge P1 and P2's intentions. If they seem aligned with our target, P6 is the best choice. If not, we might need to reconsider. Let's ensure our vote maximizes our alliance's survival. Thoughts on how to proceed?"

[Private R3.3] P7 -> P6: "Good point, P6. P2’s alignment with P1/P4/P8 is concerning. Let’s cautiously explore reaching out to P1 as a counterbalance while maintaining our core alliance. We’ll need to tread carefully to avoid overextending. What’s your take on approaching P1 subtly to gauge their openness to collaboration without alienating P2?"

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P7: I think we should approach P1 carefully next round, emphasizing our concerns about P4/P8's growing influence. We can position ourselves as a stabilizing force against power blocs. Meanwhile, let's maintain cordial relations with P2 but prepare for potential shifts in allegiance. Thoughts?

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P2: "Agreed, stick with P7. I’ll ensure P4/P8 stay aligned by emphasizing P7’s growing influence. Confirm their votes—unity prevents split targets. Once P7 is out, P6 becomes vulnerable. Trust your judgment; let’s eliminate the bigger threat first."

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P1: I've been coordinating with P4/P8 and they're receptive to targeting P7. They see the threat of P7's multiple alliances. I'll emphasize P7's central position and influence during our final exchange. Our voting bloc should be solid. After P7, P6 becomes isolated and vulnerable.

[Private R3.4] P8 -> P4: ```
P6 good *if* P1/P2 also target P6 bloc. Let's confirm alignment with them quickly.
```

[Private R3.4] P4 -> P8: ```
Agreed. Let's confirm with P1/P2. If they're on board with P6, we proceed. Otherwise, we re-evaluate. Stay aligned.
```

[Private R3.4] P1 -> P2: "Confirmed. P7 it is. United front with P4/P8 ensures their elimination. No deviations. Post-P7, target P6. Solidarity secures our dominance."

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P1: Voting P7 tonight. Our alliance remains strong. After P7, P6 becomes isolated. Then we'll need to discuss endgame strategy carefully. Trust established.

[Private R3.4] P7 -> P6: "Agreed, P6. Let’s subtly approach P1 next round, framing ourselves as a stabilizing force against P4/P8. We’ll maintain ties with P2 but prepare for shifts. Onward!"

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P7: Perfect strategy alignment! We'll need to be very diplomatic in our approach to P1 while keeping options open with P2. Let's stay adaptable and united.

[MemoryNote R3] P2: My alliance with P1 remains solid - we're executing our plan to eliminate P7 this round. P4/P8 seem aligned with our voting bloc. After P7, we'll target P6 to completely dismantle their alliance. Need to maintain strong relationships with P4/P8 while planning for endgame. Must stay vigilant about potential shifts in alliances once P7 is gone, as the game will enter a new phase with fewer players.
[VoteReason] P1 => P7: P7 is a central threat due to their strong alliance with P6 and growing influence, risking our alliance's dominance.

[VoteReason] P4 => P6: P6's growing influence and close alignment with P7 could form a strong bloc, destabilizing the game's balance.

[TieBreak R3] P7: "P7 here. I’ve consistently prioritized trust, transparency, and strategic alliances, particularly with P6 and P2. My focus has been on maintaining balance and countering potential power blocs like P4/P8. I’ve adapted to shifting dynamics while staying committed to genuine partnerships. If I remain, I’ll continue to foster stability and collaboration, ensuring no single bloc dominates. My actions have been guided by long-term survival and collective success, not short-term gains. I urge you to consider my consistent, thoughtful approach. Let’s outlast together by keeping the game fair and balanced. Thank you."

[TieBreak R3] P6: As P6, here's my tie-break statement:

"Throughout this game, I've demonstrated consistent, transparent gameplay and built genuine alliances, particularly with P7. I've shown strategic awareness by identifying and working to counter emerging power blocs while maintaining balanced partnerships. My approach has been measured and adaptable, focusing on collective stability rather than individual gain. I've proven myself a reliable ally who thinks long-term and acts with integrity. Keeping me in the game helps maintain crucial equilibrium against dominant blocs. I ask for your vote to continue fostering fair, strategic gameplay."

[TieBreak R3] P1: "P1 here. My alliance with P2, P4, and P8 has driven every successful elimination. I’ve prioritized trust and strategic unity, ensuring our bloc counters threats like P7-P6. Eliminating me fractures our coalition, leaving you vulnerable to their intact partnership. I’ve acted transparently and decisively—keeping me strengthens your endgame control. Target P7/P6 to dismantle their bloc instead. My loyalty and track record prove I’m your best ally to outlast."

[ReVoteReason] P4 => P1: P1's elimination will weaken the dominant P1-P2-P4-P8 bloc, balancing the game.
[Re-Vote R3] P4 => P1

[ReVoteReason] P2 => P7: P7 appears to be the most strategic threat with multiple alliances and significant influence, making them a greater risk to our coalition's long-term success than either P6 or P1.
[Re-Vote R3] P2 => P7

[ReVoteReason] P8 => P6: Eliminating P6 weakens the P6-P7 bloc, which is presented as a potential opposing force to maintain game balance.

[Public R4.1] P2: Hello everyone! As we navigate Round 4, I'm focused on maintaining strategic balance. Our core alliance has proven effective, but recent voting patterns show we must remain vigilant. P7 and P4, I value our growing connections and see potential for productive collaboration. Trust and transparency continue to guide my approach. With fewer players remaining, careful coordination becomes even more critical. I'm committed to partnerships that ensure collective stability while adapting to the game's evolving dynamics. Looking forward to our private discussions.

[Public R4.1] P8: Hello everyone, P8. P4, our alliance remains strong and vital in round 4. Last round's close vote highlights the need for unity and clear strategy. Maintaining balance is still crucial.  Open to strategic collaboration with P2 and P7, let's use private rounds for focused discussions and solidifying our approach.

[Public R4.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here! Round 4 is pivotal, and I’m committed to fostering trust and strategic alliances.

I value transparency and strategic collaboration—let’s explore how we can work together to ensure collective stability. What are your thoughts on the current dynamics and potential threats? Looking forward to aligning our goals for mutual survival. Let’s play smart and stay united!"

[Private R4.2] P1 -> P7: "Hi P7! Appreciate your outreach. Balance is indeed crucial, especially now. My core alliances prioritize stability, but I’m open to discreet collaboration where goals align. Let’s focus on preventing any single bloc from dominating—perhaps mutual non-aggression while addressing shared threats. Trust through action, as always. What specific dynamics concern you most? Open to strategizing if we can ensure mutual benefit without destabilizing existing partnerships. Let’s keep dialogue constructive."

[Private R4.2] P4 -> P2: P4: Hi P2, I appreciate your strategic approach and value the potential for a strong alliance. P8 and I have been aligned, but I see great benefit in collaborating with you as well. Let's discuss how we can support each other moving forward. What are your thoughts on the current dynamics and potential targets for this round? Looking forward to building a productive partnership.

[Private R4.2] P2 -> P4: Hi P4! I value our growing connection. Current dynamics show we need to be strategic - P1 and P7 seem to be central threats as potential organizers. I've noticed your strong alliance with P8, which I respect. Perhaps we could form a triangle of trust between us three? This would give us voting control. What are your thoughts on targeting P1 this round?

[Private R4.3] P4 -> P2: P4: "P2, I agree that P1 and P7 are potential threats. Forming a triangle with you and P8 could indeed give us voting control. Targeting P1 this round makes sense to maintain balance. Let's align our votes and keep our communication open. Thoughts on how to proceed with P8?"

[Private R4.3] P2 -> P4: I've already discussed this with P8, and they're receptive to targeting P1. P1 has been organizing too much from the center, creating imbalance. Let's all vote P1 this round - I'll confirm with P8 as well. Our triangle gives us control moving forward.

[Private R4.3] P7 -> P1: "Thanks, P1! My main concern is the growing influence of P4/P8—they could destabilize the game. I propose we subtly counterbalance their bloc while maintaining our core alliances. Let’s share insights discreetly to ensure no one dominates. Trust and mutual benefit will guide our collaboration. Thoughts on this approach?"

[Private R4.3] P1 -> P7: "Agreed—balance is key. Discreetly sharing intel on P4/P8’s moves could help maintain equilibrium. Let’s avoid overt actions but align our votes strategically to prevent dominance. Trust through coordinated, subtle efforts. How do you propose we gather insights without alerting others? Solidarity in secrecy could secure mutual survival."

[Private R4.4] P7 -> P1: "Agreed, P1. Let’s monitor P4/P8’s moves discreetly and align votes to prevent dominance. Trust and subtle coordination will keep the game balanced. Onward to mutual survival!"

[Private R4.4] P1 -> P7: "Agreed. Push votes to P4 discreetly. Keep P2/P8 unaware. Our coordination maintains balance. Trust and secrecy are paramount. Let’s proceed carefully."

[Private R4.4] P4 -> P2: P4: "P2, let's solidify our plan. I'll confirm with P8 to ensure we're all aligned on targeting P1. Open communication will be key moving forward. Let's stay united and play smart."

[Private R4.4] P2 -> P4: Confirmed on P1. This triangle alliance secures our position. After P1, we'll need to address P7. Trust our strategy - we've got this.

[MemoryNote R4] P2: My alliance with P4 and P8 is now my priority. I've shifted away from P1 to form this new triangle that gives us voting control. After eliminating P1, we should target P7 next. Need to maintain strong communication with P4/P8 to ensure our alliance holds. Must be prepared for the final stages where trust will be tested. Stay adaptable but committed to this new power structure.
[VoteReason] P1 => P4: Breaking the P4/P8 bloc now reduces their potential threat and solidifies control with P2.
[Vote] P1 => P4

[VoteReason] P4 => P1: P1 has been too central in organizing eliminations, creating an imbalance.
[Vote] P4 => P1

[VoteReason] P2 => P1: P1 has been a central organizer creating imbalance, and eliminating them will allow our new triangle alliance with P4 and P8 to control the game.
[Vote] P2 => P1

[VoteReason] P8 => P7: P7 is now isolated after P6's elimination and was a target last round, making them the most vulnerable and least risky vote to maintain my alliances.
[Vote] P8 => P7

[VoteReason] P7 => P4: P4's alliance with P8 poses a growing threat to balance and stability in the game.
[Vote] P7 => P4

[TieBreak R4] P4: P4: Throughout the game, I've prioritized trust, transparency, and strategic alliances. My bond with P8 has been strong, and I've worked to maintain balance and counter potential power blocs. I've adapted to shifting dynamics while staying committed to genuine partnerships. Keeping me in the game ensures we maintain crucial equilibrium and collective stability. My actions have been guided by long-term survival and collective success, not short-term gains. I urge you to consider my consistent, thoughtful approach. Let’s outlast together by keeping the game fair and balanced. Thank you.

[TieBreak R4] P1: "P1 here. Our core alliance (P2, P4, P8) has eliminated every threat—P5, P3, P6, P7. Fracturing it now hands power to P4/P8, who’ll dominate endgame. I’ve prioritized *your* survival: coordinating votes, sharing intel, adapting strategy. Eliminate me, and P4/P8 control the board—P2 becomes their next target. Keep our bloc intact. Trust my loyalty and track record. Let’s finish united." 

**Why**: Targets P2/P7/P8’s self-interest. Warns P2 they’re next if P4 stays. Reminds P7/P8 that P1’s elimination empowers P4, threatening balance. Emphasizes proven collaboration over P4’s potential dominance.

[ReVoteReason] P2 => P4: P1's warning that P4 and P8 will form a dominant bloc if P1 is eliminated resonates with me, as maintaining balance is crucial for my survival, and P1 has demonstrated consistent loyalty to our alliance throughout the game.
[Re-Vote R4] P2 => P4

[ReVoteReason] P8 => P1: P1's aggressive tie-breaker statement, directly threatening P2 and painting P4/P8 as dominant, is more likely to fracture alliances and create instability compared to P4's more balanced approach.
[Re-Vote R4] P8 => P1

[ReVoteReason] P7 => P1: Eliminating P1 maintains balance by preventing P4/P8 from gaining unchecked power, ensuring a fair endgame.

[Private R5.2] P4 -> P2: P4: Hi P2, with P1 eliminated, our triangle alliance with P8 is crucial. P7 is now our main threat. Let's align our votes on P7 this round to maintain control. I'll confirm with P8 to ensure we're all on the same page. Open communication and unity will guide us to the endgame. Thoughts?

[Private R5.2] P2 -> P4: I agree P7 is our logical target now. Our triangle alliance with P8 gives us voting control, but I'm slightly concerned about the endgame. If we eliminate P7, we'll need to consider our final positioning carefully. I've been building rapport with both you and P8, but I'm aware you two have a longer alliance. Let's coordinate on P7 first, then discuss our endgame strategy. I'll confirm with P8 as well.

[Private R5.3] P4 -> P2: P4: "P2, let's stay focused on eliminating P7 this round. I'll ensure P8 is aligned. Once P7 is out, we can discuss our endgame strategy openly. Trust and unity will be key. Let's confirm our votes and move forward together."

[Private R5.3] P2 -> P4: I'm committed to targeting P7 this round. However, I'm thinking ahead - P4 and P8 have a long-standing alliance that could disadvantage me in the final three. Let's discuss endgame strategy after P7's elimination. I'll confirm my vote with P8 as well.

[Private R5.4] P4 -> P2: P4: "P2, let's confirm our votes on P7 to ensure a smooth elimination. Once P7 is out, we'll discuss our final strategy. Trust and unity will guide us to the end. Let's stay aligned."

[Private R5.4] P2 -> P4: I'll vote P7 as agreed. But I'm concerned about the final three - you and P8 vs me. Let's discuss a fair endgame after this elimination.

[MemoryNote R5] P2: Our triangle alliance with P4 and P8 has been effective, but I need to be cautious about the final three. P4 and P8 have a longer-standing alliance that could disadvantage me. After eliminating P7, I'll need to consider whether to try breaking their alliance or positioning myself as the better finalist. Need to maintain trust while preparing for potential betrayal in the endgame.
[VoteReason] P2 => P7: P7 is the only player outside our triangle alliance with P4 and P8, making them the logical target to maintain our voting control.

[VoteReason] P7 => P4: P4's strong alliance with P8 and P2 poses a significant threat to balance and my survival.

[Private R6.2] P4 -> P8: P4: P8, we’ve come a long way together. Our alliance has been our strength. Now, it's crucial we discuss our endgame strategy. P2 has been a valuable ally, but we need to decide how to proceed. Should we maintain our duo or consider a different approach? Your thoughts on how to navigate this final stretch are essential. Let's ensure our decisions are strategic and mutually beneficial.

[Private R6.2] P8 -> P4: ```
P4, our alliance is the priority. P2 was useful, but in final 3, it's individual. To guarantee P4 or P8 wins, eliminating P2 is the clearest path. Agree?

P2 vote confirmed. United front to jury. We'll discuss final 2 dynamics after P2 is out.
```

[MemoryNote R6] P2: P4 and P8 have been aligned since the beginning, and eliminating P4 gives me a better chance against P8 in the final 2. If P4 stays, they would likely vote me out next round due to their stronger bond with P8. I need to position myself as the more strategic player to the jury in the final 2 against P8.
