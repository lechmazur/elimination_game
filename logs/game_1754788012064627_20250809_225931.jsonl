I've built real connections with many of you, sharing honest thoughts while navigating the game's challenges.\n\nI've survived by adapting and forming authentic bonds, not by manipulating or targeting others unfairly. My approach has been to play with integrity while still making strategic moves when necessary.\n\nI ask for your vote based on how I've conducted myself - with respect for all players and a balanced approach to the game's social and strategic elements.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 00:09:21"}
