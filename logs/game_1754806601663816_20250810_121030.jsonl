I’ve engaged thoughtfully with every seat, balancing collaboration and competition. My opponent, while strong, has shown moments of unpredictability that could undermine trust. I’ve earned my place here through clear reasoning and respect for the process. Keep me, and you reward consistency and integrity. Eliminate me, and you risk rewarding volatility.
