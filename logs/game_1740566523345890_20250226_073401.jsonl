Our alliance proved effective in round one. I noticed P4 publicly declared their partnership with P3 - this could be both a strength and vulnerability for them. \n\nFor this round, we should consider P6 or P2 as potential targets.

And have you formed any other alliances we should be aware of?", "timestamp": "2025-02-26 07:42:10"}
