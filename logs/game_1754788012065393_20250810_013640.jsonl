Our alliance with P4 has been the backbone of this game—built on trust, consistency, and strategic execution. P6’s adaptability has been impressive, but the endgame requires more than survival; it demands vision. I prioritize partners who align on long-term strategy and jury appeal. Let’s use this round to solidify our path to victory. Open to private conversations with both to ensure our final moves are decisive. Stay sharp, stay unified. Good luck to all.\n\n*(Word count: 80)*", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 02:08:33"}
