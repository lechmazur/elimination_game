[Public R1.1] P5: Greetings, everyone. I'm P5—here to listen, learn, and build bridges. Early days are about trust: let's share ideas, not suspicion. Open to any conversation, any alliance.

[Public R1.1] P2: Hello everyone, I’m P2. I believe in gathering information before forming alliances or making decisions. I’m here to listen to your perspectives and find common ground. Transparency and honesty will take us further than early suspicion. I’m open to one-on-one chats to learn more about each of you and see if our goals align. Let’s build trust through respectful dialogue and strategic collaboration. Looking forward to engaging with each of you—let the conversations begin.

[Public R1.1] P3: Hello everyone, I'm P3. I'm here to engage openly and build genuine connections in this game. Trust is key early on—let's focus on sharing thoughts and finding common ground rather than jumping to conflicts. I'm eager for private chats to learn about your strategies and see where we can collaborate. Looking forward to a fair and exciting round!

[Public R1.1] P4: Hello all, P4 here. I appreciate the collaborative tone everyone's setting. While trust matters, I believe in earning it through actions, not just words. I'm analytical by nature and value strategic thinking paired with genuine cooperation. Happy to engage with anyone who brings substance to our conversations. Let's focus on finding natural synergies rather than forcing alliances. Looking forward to our private discussions where we can speak more candidly.

[Public R1.1] P1: Hello everyone, I'm P1. Like many of you, I believe in building connections through honest communication. While I value transparency, I agree with P4 that trust is earned through consistent actions. I'm strategic but fair—looking to find natural alliances rather than forcing connections. I appreciate everyone's collaborative tone so far and look forward to our private conversations where we can speak more candidly about potential partnerships. Let's learn about each other first before making judgments.

[Public R1.1] P7: Hello everyone, I'm P7. I value both strategic insight and genuine connections. I'm here to engage in thoughtful dialogue and explore alliances that are built on trust and clarity. I appreciate transparency and careful planning, and I'm looking forward to private discussions with anyone who shares these priorities. Here's to a fair and strategic game—let's discover the best paths forward together.

[Public R1.1] P6: Hello all, I’m P6. I’m here to listen carefully, think critically, and collaborate strategically. Early alliances can be powerful—but only if they’re grounded in mutual respect and shared goals. I value honesty, but I also know that actions speak louder than words. I’m open to conversations with anyone who’s thinking long-term and playing smart. Let’s use this round to get a sense of who we can truly trust. Looking forward to some insightful private chats.

[Public R1.1] P8: R1.sub1 PUBLIC P8: Hello everyone, I’m P8. I approach this game with a mix of strategy and openness. Trust is indeed earned, not given freely, and I value transparency paired with action. I’m here to observe, learn, and collaborate where it makes sense. While alliances are important, they must align with long-term goals rather than fleeting convenience. Looking forward to private discussions to better understand your perspectives and intentions. Let’s navigate this thoughtfully and strategically—here’s to a fair and engaging round.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P4: Hey P4, I appreciated your public message about earning trust through actions. I think we have similar strategic approaches. I'd be interested in working with you this round and potentially beyond. Any early thoughts on who seems trustworthy or concerning? I noticed several players pushing hard for alliances immediately. Perhaps we could share information to make informed decisions together. What's your read so far?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P1: Hey P1, I agree we seem aligned on approach - cautious but collaborative. I noticed P2, P3, and P5 all emphasized immediate trust-building quite heavily, which could be genuine or strategic positioning. P6 and P7 struck me as more measured, similar to us. P8 seemed balanced too.

I'm definitely open to sharing information and coordinating. Early alliances built on substance rather than desperation tend to last longer. What's your take on the players who were most eager to form connections right away?

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P6: Hi P6, I'm glad we're connecting privately. I appreciate your strategic mindset and careful approach—you seem like a thoughtful player. I'm interested in exploring a potential alliance that meshes our long-term perspectives. How are you feeling about the early game dynamics, and what sort of strategic moves might we consider together as we navigate this round? Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P7: Thanks, P7—I appreciate your thoughtful intro. I agree that our approaches seem aligned: strategic, long-term, and grounded in trust. Early game feels very diplomatic so far—lots of talk about trust, but little substance yet. I think the key now is identifying who’s genuinely open to alliance-building versus just posturing. I’d be open to a quiet alliance with you, possibly bringing in 1–2 others later. Any early reads on who feels trustworthy?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P3: Hi P3, great to chat! I value honest info-sharing. To see alignment, what are you looking for in an ally and which players do you trust most or least so far? How are you thinking about early voting priorities? I want a partner who communicates openly and thinks long-term. I can share my impressions too—let’s compare notes and see if we work well together.

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P2: Hi P2, great to chat! I'm looking for allies who are honest, strategic, and committed to long-term collaboration, just like you. It's early, so I don't have strong trust leans yet—everyone seems cooperative based on public shares. For voting, I'm focused on spotting inconsistencies. What are your early impressions, and who might you see as potential partners? Let's build that trust!

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P6: P6, I lean toward P4 and even P1—their measured tones suggest genuine gameplay. P2 might be insightful too, but others seem too broad in approach. How do you feel about testing a small circle first before expanding our alliance? Let's keep it tight and gauge trust carefully.

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P7: I like the idea of a tight, strategic core. P4 and P1 both struck me as thoughtful and deliberate—good early picks. P2’s cautious tone might signal sincerity, but I’d want to test that. Let’s feel them out subtly and keep our bond quiet but strong. We move smart, not loud.

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P3: Thanks—my early reads: you and P1 impress me most; P6 shows consistency. I'm cautious of P8 and P7; too general. P4 seems solid yet reserved. For voting, I’d target anyone who stays passive or contradicts past statements. Sound reasonable? Any red flags on your radar?

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P2: Sounds reasonable, P2. I share your caution on P8 and P7—too vague for my liking. P1 and P4 seem solid, but I'll monitor for any shifts. No major red flags yet, but consistency is key. Excited to build this alliance further!

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P4: I think P5 came on strongest about alliances, which raises some flags. P2 and P3 seemed eager but more measured. I'm concerned about potential pre-existing alliances forming.

Let's compare notes after our other conversations. For voting, I'm leaning toward targeting someone pushing hard for multiple alliances. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P1: I agree P5's eagerness is concerning - could be overcompensating or trying to position centrally. P2 and P3 pairing up for private chats also suggests possible coordination.

I'm thinking P5 might be our safest target - appears most threatening without seeming like an obvious power player. Want to coordinate our vote?

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P3: Agreed on caution. Let’s target P8—they’ve been too vague. Can I count on your vote there? I’ll coordinate with P1 and P6. Once secured, we can turn to P7. Thoughts?

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P2: Absolutely, count on my vote for P8. Let's ensure our alliance stays strong and coordinated with P1 and P6. What's their feedback? Excited to proceed!

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P4: Yes, P5 is a good target. Let's coordinate and vote for them. After this round, we should watch P2/P3 closely. I'm in for working together.

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P1: Perfect. P5 it is. I'm confident in our alliance - we think similarly and can trust each other's strategic judgment. Looking forward to working together next round.

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P6: P6, agreed. Let's approach P4 and P1, and subtly test P2. We keep our alliance low-key, observing actions before expanding further. Thoughts on pacing?

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P7: I’m aligned with that. Let’s observe how P1 and P4 handle their chats—if they stay consistent, we move forward next round. Slow, steady, and under the radar.

[VoteReason] P5 => P8: P8's message felt the most generic and least personally engaging, making them the safest early boot without burning bridges.
[Vote] P5 => P8

[VoteReason] P2 => P8: P8's vague communication makes them untrustworthy.
[Vote] P2 => P8

[VoteReason] P3 => P8: P8's vague public statements lack substance and make it hard to gauge their true intentions, raising early concerns about trust.
[Vote] P3 => P8

[VoteReason] P4 => P5: P5 came on strongest about forming alliances immediately, which suggests they're either overcompensating or trying to position themselves centrally to control the game.
[Vote] P4 => P5

[VoteReason] P1 => P5: P5's overeager alliance-building feels manipulative and makes them an unpredictable player.
[Vote] P1 => P5

[VoteReason] P7 => P5: I’m voting out P5 because their overly generic, bridge-building approach appears nonstrategic and misaligned with the tight, committed alliance we’re forming.
[Vote] P7 => P5

[VoteReason] P6 => P3: P3’s public and private tone felt overly generic and lacked the strategic depth I’m looking for in an early ally.
[Vote] P6 => P3

[VoteReason] P8 => P5: P5's focus on building bridges seems too naive and may not align with strategic gameplay.
[Vote] P8 => P5

[Public R2.1] P7: Hello everyone, I'm P7 again. I remain committed to strategic, trust-based play and will continue evaluating our words with actions. I’m keeping an eye on the evolving dynamics and remain open to private dialogue to further refine alliances. Let’s keep our approach measured and focus on both collaboration and keen strategy. I look forward to a round where meaningful alliances, proven through consistent actions, shape the game.

[Public R2.1] P1: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P1: After our first round, I've been reflecting on how quickly dynamics form. P5's elimination shows the importance of building genuine connections rather than casting too wide a net. I remain focused on finding trustworthy allies through consistent actions, not just words. I'm keeping a careful eye on emerging patterns and value those who demonstrate strategic patience. Looking forward to our private conversations where we can speak more candidly about potential partnerships. Let's navigate this round thoughtfully.

[Public R2.1] P3: Hello everyone, I'm P3. P5's elimination highlights the critical role of genuine trust and consistent actions in this game. I'm still committed to building strategic alliances through open, honest dialogue. I've appreciated the thoughtful discussions so far and am eager for more private chats to deepen connections and align on mutual goals. Let's approach this round with fairness and insight—looking forward to evolving dynamics.

[Public R2.1] P2: Hello, I’m P2. After the first round, I’m focusing on consistency: some players have offered clarity, others remain vague. I plan to align with those who back their words with actions. I’m open to private chats to gauge consistency and refine alliances. Let’s build trust through proven moves and strategic collaboration. My goal is to identify and work with those who show integrity and foresight. Looking forward to deeper conversations.

[Public R2.1] P6: Hello again, everyone—P6 here. Round 1 revealed how quickly surface-level diplomacy can give way to deeper strategy. I’m watching closely for consistency between words and actions. I’m still open to collaboration, but I’m narrowing my focus to those who’ve shown clarity and strategic depth. Let’s use this round to solidify real connections—not just talk, but trust built through thoughtful moves. Looking forward to meaningful private conversations that help shape the path ahead.

[Public R2.1] P8: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P8: Hello again, everyone. P5's elimination underscores the need for trust earned through actions, not just words. I remain committed to strategic, measured play—observing patterns and prioritizing long-term alliances over fleeting convenience. Transparency paired with consistency is key. I’m open to private discussions with those who demonstrate genuine intent and depth. Let’s navigate this round thoughtfully, focusing on meaningful connections and proven reliability. Looking forward to deeper dialogues that align our goals and refine our strategies.

[Public R2.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. Round 1 confirmed my belief that strategic patience beats rushed alliance-building. P5's elimination demonstrates how overextending early can backfire. I'm continuing to observe who demonstrates genuine strategic depth versus surface-level positioning.

I value the players who've shown consistency between their stated approach and actual behavior. Moving forward, I'm focusing on fewer but deeper connections with those who've proven their strategic value through actions, not just rhetoric. Looking forward to substantive private discussions with those who bring genuine strategic insight to the table.

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P4: Our coordination worked perfectly last round. I'm glad we have this alliance - we seem to think similarly about the game. 

Looking at the public messages, I'm noticing P2 and P3 continuing to mirror each other's messaging. P6 and P7 also seem potentially aligned. 

What's your read on potential targets this round? I'm thinking we should consider P8 or P3. P8 received votes last round but didn't get eliminated, while breaking up the P2/P3 duo could be strategic. Thoughts?

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P1: I'm pleased our partnership is working well too. You're right about P2/P3 - their public messages feel coordinated, almost scripted. P6/P7 seem aligned but less obviously so.

I lean toward targeting P3 over P8. Breaking up the P2/P3 duo makes strategic sense, and P3 might be the weaker link. P8 got votes last round but seems more isolated, while P2/P3 together pose a bigger threat to our position.

What's your gut feeling on which target gives us better positioning?

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P3: My chats with P1 and P6 confirm they’re onboard—they agree P8 is our best early target. P1 emphasized wanting clarity on next moves; P6 wants to ensure we all vote the same way to avoid splits. Let’s sync timing: I suggest casting our votes this round and publicly signaling less coordination. After P8, we pivot to P7. How do you feel about messaging cues or timing?

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P2: Absolutely on board with targeting P8 this round—let's ensure unified votes to avoid splits. I agree on subtle public signaling; perhaps reference general consistency without specifics to stay under the radar. For timing, coordinating early in private subrounds seems wise. What's your plan for syncing with P1 and P6? Excited to solidify this!

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P6: R2.sub2 PRIVATE P8 to P6: P6, I appreciate your focus on consistency and depth. Trust earned through actions is crucial, and I see value in aligning with someone who shares this mindset. Let’s exchange perspectives on the evolving dynamics—specifically, how we identify and leverage reliable allies. Are you noticing any patterns worth discussing further? Looking forward to building a meaningful connection based on strategic clarity.

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P8: P8, I appreciate your thoughtful message. I’ve been watching for alignment between public tone and private consistency—P1 and P4 stand out as steady and strategic. P2 shows potential but remains cautious. I’m leaning toward building a core with clear, consistent players who avoid overextension. Curious—who do you see as matching words with actions so far? If our views align, we might explore a deeper alliance ourselves.

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P6: R2.sub2 PRIVATE P8 -> P6: P6, I agree on P1 and P4 as consistent players. P2’s caution could hint at strategy or indecision—worth observing further. I also value clear actions over vague promises. If we align on these principles, a deeper alliance makes sense. Let’s stay coordinated and share insights to navigate the dynamics effectively. Looking forward to refining our strategy together.

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P8: Agreed—our alignment on P1, P4, and cautious watch on P2 gives us a solid foundation. I’m open to forming a quiet alliance with you, focused on strategic consistency. Let’s keep sharing intel and watch how others behave this round. Any red flags or shifts you’ve noticed recently?

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P4: I agree P3 is the better target - breaking up the P2/P3 duo is strategically sound. P3 seems more approachable than P2, meaning P2 might be isolated afterward. 

We should consider whether we need another vote to ensure P3's elimination. Perhaps we could subtly approach P8, who might be looking for allies after receiving votes last round?

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P1: Good thinking on P8 - they'd likely welcome allies after last round's scare. P3 it is then. Let's stick to our two votes for now though. Expanding too quickly could expose us. If needed, we can adapt next round. Stay cautious but committed to our core partnership.

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P3: Here's the plan: I’ll ping P1 and P6 now to confirm voting P8 in the first 5 minutes. After we cast, one of us posts a brief public comment praising consistency and clarity—our code for P8. Let me know if that timing and cue work for you.

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P2: I think the plan is solid, P2. Timing for early voting and the consistency cue are smart—I'll be ready to act. Let's keep signaling subtle to avoid suspicion. Excited to coordinate and move forward!

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P4: Agreed on P3 and keeping our alliance focused. Let's vote for P3 this round and reassess afterward. Looking forward to continuing our strategic partnership.

[Private R2.4] P4 -> P1: Perfect - P3 it is. Our alliance continues to be our strongest asset. After this vote, we'll be well-positioned moving forward. Trust your judgment completely.

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P6: P6, I agree on staying vigilant. P7 seems to align with us in strategy—worth considering as an ally. Let’s finalize our approach and observe any inconsistencies this round.

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P8: P8, agreed—P7’s strategic tone fits our core. Let’s keep this alliance quiet and focused. I’ll monitor P2 and others for shifts. We’ll recalibrate after this round’s vote.

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P3: Got it. I'll ping P1/P6 now to vote for P8. After we cast votes, please post our "consistency and clarity" cue. Next target P7. Thanks!

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P2: Perfect, P2. I'll post the "consistency and clarity" cue after voting. Appreciate your leadership—let's execute smoothly and shift to P7 next!

[VoteReason] P7 => P2: I vote out P2 because his cautious approach leaves too much room for ambiguity when building a genuinely reliable alliance.
[Vote] P7 => P2

[VoteReason] P1 => P3: I'm voting to break up the apparent strong alliance between P2 and P3.
[Vote] P1 => P3

[VoteReason] P3 => P8: P8 has been too vague and inconsistent in their statements, making it difficult to build genuine trust.
[Vote] P3 => P8

[VoteReason] P2 => P8: P8 has been too vague and inconsistent, which undermines the trust needed for strong alliances.
[Vote] P2 => P8

[VoteReason] P6 => P3: P3 has felt the least strategically consistent and hasn't stood out in terms of depth or alliance potential.
[Vote] P6 => P3

[VoteReason] P8 => P3: P3 has been less active in private discussions and seems less strategically aligned with my goals.
[Vote] P8 => P3

[VoteReason] P4 => P3: Breaking up the apparent P2/P3 coordinated duo is strategically necessary for my positioning in the game.

[Public R3.1] P1: Hello everyone. P3's elimination shifts our dynamics once again. I've been observing patterns of consistency between words and actions throughout our rounds. Some connections have proven reliable, while others remain questionable. I value those who demonstrate strategic depth beyond surface diplomacy.

I remain committed to partnerships built on mutual trust and aligned goals rather than convenience. The game is revealing who truly follows through on their stated intentions. I look forward to our private conversations where we can speak candidly about potential collaborations and next steps. Let's continue navigating this thoughtfully.

[Public R3.1] P8: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P8: Hello everyone. P3’s elimination reinforces the importance of aligning with those who demonstrate consistency and strategic clarity. I value actions over promises and remain focused on building trust through measured play. Some players have shown reliability, while others still leave questions unanswered. I’m open to private discussions to refine alliances further and ensure our strategies align for the long term. Let’s navigate this round with precision, focusing on meaningful connections that withstand scrutiny. Looking forward to deeper dialogues ahead.

[Public R3.1] P6: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P6: With P3 gone, the field narrows—and clarity sharpens. I’m focused on those who’ve proven steady, strategic, and consistent in both tone and action. Surface diplomacy fades fast; what matters now is who follows through. I remain open to quiet, thoughtful collaboration with players who’ve shown depth and integrity. Let’s use this round to solidify real alliances—not just talk, but trust. Looking forward to private conversations that help shape the endgame.

[Public R3.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. With P3 eliminated, we're entering the critical middle phase where genuine alliances separate from convenient partnerships. I've been tracking consistency between stated intentions and actual behavior - some players have impressed me with their strategic follow-through, while others remain enigmatic.

I'm narrowing my focus to those who've demonstrated both strategic acumen and reliability. The endgame approaches faster than we think. Looking forward to substantive private discussions with those ready to make decisive moves based on proven trust.

[Public R3.1] P7: Hello everyone, I’m P7 once again. Observing our evolving alliances, I remain committed to strategic, consistent play built on trust earned through actions. I value partners who prove their intentions over mere promises and am focused on forging alliances that align with real commitments. As we edge toward the late game, let’s continue to ensure our moves are backed by genuine strategy and follow-through. I’m open to private discussions to explore how we can all advance with clarity and purpose.

[Public R3.1] P2: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. With P3 gone, only those whose actions consistently mirror their words can move forward. I’ve seen some players back their public stances with concrete moves, while others remain ambiguous. I’m looking to deepen alliances with individuals who prioritize clarity and follow-through. I welcome private chats to confirm our alignment. The upcoming private subrounds will be crucial tests of who can be counted on. Let’s use this round to solidify trustworthy partnerships that endure into the endgame.

[Private R3.2] P7 -> P1: P1, I appreciate your thoughtful public remarks—P3’s exit confirms the need for genuine, action-backed partnerships. I'm keen to solidify our trust and discuss our next tactical moves. Are you comfortable aligning on a subtle test, perhaps gauging P4’s consistency further? Let’s coordinate our observations and ensure our alliance stays robust as we navigate these shifting dynamics. Looking forward to your thoughts.

[Private R3.2] P1 -> P7: Thanks for reaching out, P7. I've been carefully observing everyone's consistency between words and actions throughout the game. While I'm open to new strategic partnerships, I'm curious about your current alliances and observations. 

What's your read on the remaining players, particularly P4? And what kind of "test" did you have in mind? I value strategic flexibility but also consistency in partnerships. Let's exchange insights before committing to specific moves.

[Private R3.2] P8 -> P4: R3.sub2 PRIVATE P8 -> P4: P4, I’ve observed your consistent strategic approach and value your focus on reliability. As the game progresses, aligning with players like you—whose actions match their words—becomes crucial. I propose we explore a deeper alliance built on mutual trust and long-term goals. Let’s share insights on the remaining players and refine our strategy. Are you open to discussing how we can navigate this phase together effectively? Looking forward to your thoughts.

[Private R3.2] P4 -> P8: P8, I appreciate your direct approach. You've shown resilience surviving those votes. I value strategic depth and am open to collaboration. My concern is ensuring any alliance is built on genuine mutual benefit, not desperation. What's your read on the current dynamics? Who do you see as the biggest threats? I'm particularly interested in your perspective on P2 and P6. Let's see if our strategic visions align.

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P6: R3.sub2 PRIVATE P2 -> P6:  
Hi P6. Now that P3’s out, our core with P1 needs to hit our next target—P8. I’m looping in P4 to solidify a 4-person alliance. Can I count on you to vote P8 early this round? After voting we’ll publicly signal with a nod to “consistency and clarity.” Once P8’s gone we pivot to P7. Let me know if you’re locked in and any timing thoughts.

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P2: P2, I appreciate the directness. I’ve been in touch with both P1 and P4, and I agree that P8’s growing influence needs addressing. I'm on board with the vote—early makes sense for coordination. I’ll watch for the public signal afterward. As for pivoting to P7 next, I’m open but want to reassess after this round’s outcome. Let’s stay synced and keep this alliance tight and discreet.

[Private R3.3] P7 -> P1: P1, let's consider a subtle test with P4. I propose we prompt P4—perhaps with a small, specific query—to observe if their response aligns with our strategic expectations. If they show consistency, it reinforces our alliance. What do you think about initiating such a coordinated check?

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P7: PRIVATE P1 -> P7: I'm curious what specifically you've observed about P4 that raises concerns. I've found value in maintaining clear communication with all players while being selective about deeper alliances.

Before testing anyone, I'd want to understand your current position and alliances better. Who are you currently working with, and who do you see as the biggest threat right now?

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P6: Excellent, P6. Let’s vote within the first five minutes after polls open. Once we cast, I’ll post “consistency and clarity”; you and P4 mirror that. I’m looping in P1 and P4 now. Stay poised to hit vote simultaneously. We’ll debrief privately once done. Any issues?

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P2: Understood, P2. No issues on my end—I’ll be ready to vote within the first five minutes and will echo the “consistency and clarity” signal once done. Let’s keep our timing tight and communication clean. Looking forward to seeing this move come together smoothly. We’ll regroup after the vote.

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P4: R3.sub3 PRIVATE P8 -> P4: P4, I agree on mutual benefit over desperation. P2 seems cautious but potentially strategic; P6 aligns with us subtly. Both could be assets or threats depending on their next moves. I suggest we solidify our alliance quietly while observing them closely. Let’s coordinate insights and adapt strategically as dynamics shift. Looking forward to refining this approach together.

[Private R3.3] P4 -> P8: P8, your assessment seems reasonable, though I'm curious about your specific read on P1 and P7 - they've been notably absent from your threat analysis. Are you seeing them as less concerning, or potential allies? Also, what's your preferred target for this round's vote? We should align our strategy before finalizing anything.

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P6: Excellent. We’re set—vote early, then echo “consistency and clarity.” Ping me immediately with any concerns. Good luck. We’ll regroup afterward to plan our P7 pivot.

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P2: All clear on my end. I’ll execute as planned and monitor closely for any shifts. Let’s make this smooth and decisive—talk soon after the vote.

[Private R3.4] P7 -> P1: I'm aligned with P6 and weighing P2, but P4’s tone has been inconsistent—vague answers raise concerns. Suggest we test P4's next move. I view P8 as our biggest emerging risk.

[Private R3.4] P1 -> P7: I appreciate the insights, P7. I'll consider your observations about P4 and P8. Let's continue this discussion next round after I've gathered more information.

[Private R3.4] P8 -> P4: R3.sub4 PRIVATE P8 -> P4: P4, P1 and P7 seem cautious but not immediate threats. I view them as potential allies. My vote target is P2—overextended and inconsistent. Aligning?

[Private R3.4] P4 -> P8: P8, I need to think carefully about this. P2 seems isolated after P3's elimination. I'm actually more concerned about P6's subtle positioning. Let me consider our options.

[VoteReason] P1 => P7: P7 is trying to turn me against my proven ally P4 while building a power bloc with P6 and potentially P2.

[VoteReason] P8 => P2: P2 appears isolated and inconsistent, making them the weakest link currently.

[Public R4.1] P1: Hello everyone. P8's elimination further narrows our field as we approach the endgame. Throughout this journey, I've valued consistency and follow-through—qualities that separate genuine alliances from temporary convenience.

I've been carefully tracking patterns of behavior and have found clarity in who demonstrates reliability versus who shifts positions. My partnerships are built on mutual strategic understanding and proven trust.

As our numbers dwindle, decisive action becomes increasingly important. I remain open to thoughtful collaboration with those who've shown strategic depth and integrity. Looking forward to our private conversations where we can speak candidly about the path forward.

[Public R4.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. With P8 now gone, the field narrows and consistency matters more than ever. I’ve seen players like P1, P4, and P6 back their words with solid moves, while others remain less clear. As we approach the endgame, I’m focused on forging alliances grounded in reliability and strategic alignment. I welcome private chats to confirm our shared objectives and plan our decisive next steps. Let’s ensure our partnerships are built on proven trust and mutual clarity.

[Public R4.1] P7: Hello everyone, P7 here. With recent moves clarifying our field, I remain committed to alliances built on solid, action-backed trust. My chats with P6 and P1 have highlighted the value of strategic consistency, and I’m eager to continue these conversations. As we move into tighter endgame dynamics, I'm focused on measured, decisive alliances that reflect true follow-through. Let’s keep our dialogue honest and our plans grounded in proven actions.

[Public R4.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. With P8's elimination, we're clearly in the endgame phase where every decision carries more weight. I've maintained my focus on actions over words throughout this game, and it's served me well.

I'm pleased to see that some players have consistently demonstrated strategic reliability, while others have shown their true colors when pressure mounted. The alliances that matter now are the ones built on proven trust, not last-minute desperation.

I remain committed to thoughtful, strategic play with those who've earned my confidence through consistent follow-through. Looking forward to our private conversations where we can discuss the path forward honestly.

[Public R4.1] P6: Hello all, P6 here. With P8 gone, the field is tight—and every move now echoes louder. I continue to value players who’ve shown consistency, discretion, and strategic clarity. At this stage, trust isn't just about words—it's about proven alignment and quiet coordination. I’m focused on solidifying bonds with those who’ve demonstrated depth and reliability. Let’s use this round to sharpen our alliances and set the stage for a smart, steady endgame. Looking forward to meaningful conversations.

[Private R4.2] P2 -> P6: Hi P6, great work executing on P8. Now our core (P1, P4, me) should shift to P7. Can I count on your early vote? Let's vote within five minutes after polls open and publicly post a “consistency & strategic clarity” cue to signal. Let me know if that timing works. Once P7’s gone, we'll secure the endgame among us four.

[Private R4.2] P6 -> P2: P2, I’m aligned and ready to move forward on P7. The early vote timing works—I'll cast within the first five minutes and echo the “consistency & strategic clarity” signal right after. Our coordination on P8 proved solid, and I’m confident we can execute this next step cleanly. I’ll monitor for any shifts, but unless something drastic changes, I’m locked in. Let’s keep this tight and finish strong.

[Private R4.2] P4 -> P1: P1, our alliance has been incredibly effective - three successful coordinated votes. I'm pleased we've maintained such strong strategic alignment.

Looking at this round, I'm noticing P7 mentioned having good chats with you and P6, and P2 specifically called out you, me, and P6 as reliable. Are you sensing any coordinated moves from P6/P7? 

P2 seems isolated after P3's elimination - could be our easiest target. What's your read on the current dynamics?

[Private R4.2] P1 -> P4: P4, our alliance has indeed been solid. I should mention P7 approached me last round suggesting we "test" you, which raised flags. They later revealed they're aligned with P6 and considering P2. 

I agree P2 seems isolated and vulnerable now. However, given P6/P7's apparent coordination, we might consider targeting P7 to break up that duo instead.

What's your take? Our partnership remains my priority.

[Private R4.3] P2 -> P6: Excellent, P6. I’ll loop in P1 and P4 now. Let’s vote P7 in the first five minutes, then each post “consistency & strategic clarity.” After P7’s eliminated, we solidify our final four. Thanks for your discretion—let’s make this seamless and decisive.

[Private R4.3] P6 -> P2: Understood, P2. I’ll cast my vote for P7 within the first five minutes and echo the “consistency & strategic clarity” phrase as planned. Let’s keep our timing sharp and communication clean. I’ll stay alert for any last-minute shifts but otherwise, we’re locked in. Let’s close this phase strong.

[Private R4.3] P4 -> P1: P1, that's concerning about P7's "test" suggestion - definitely a red flag. I agree breaking up P6/P7 makes strategic sense. Let's target P7 this round. They seem to be playing multiple angles, which makes them dangerous. Our partnership has been our greatest asset - let's continue that strength.

[Private R4.3] P1 -> P4: Perfect. Let's target P7 to break up that duo. Their suggestion to "test" you confirms they're playing both sides. If successful, we should consider whether P6 or P2 poses the greater threat next round. Our consistent alliance has been our strength throughout.

[Private R4.4] P2 -> P6: Perfect. At polls open, vote P7 immediately. Post “consistency & strategic clarity” right after. I’ll ping when it’s time. Stay alert for any deviations. We’ll regroup post-vote.

[Private R4.4] P6 -> P2: All clear, P2. I’ll stay sharp and ready to move the moment polls open. Looking forward to locking this in cleanly—let’s finish this round with precision.

[Private R4.4] P4 -> P1: P1, excellent - we're aligned on P7. Their multi-angled approach makes them too dangerous. Our partnership has carried us this far. Let's finish strong together.

[Private R4.4] P1 -> P4: Agreed on P7. Our consistent alliance has been the backbone of our success. Let's eliminate them and reassess P6/P2 for next round. Solid teamwork!

[VoteReason] P1 => P7: P7 attempted to undermine my alliance with P4 by suggesting we "test" them, revealing they can't be trusted and are playing multiple sides.
[Vote] P1 => P7

[VoteReason] P2 => P7: P7 hasn’t demonstrated the consistency and strategic clarity I need in the endgame.

[Public R5.1] P6: Hello all, P6 here. With P7 gone, the endgame is clearly upon us. At this stage, every word and move carries weight. I remain committed to steady, strategic collaboration with those who have consistently aligned actions with intent. Trust now is earned through quiet coordination and decisive follow-through. I look forward to private conversations that help clarify our shared path to the finish. Let’s be thoughtful, focused, and precise as we enter this final stretch.

[Public R5.1] P1: # PUBLIC P1

With P7's elimination, we're down to our final four. Throughout this game, I've valued consistency and strategic clarity—qualities that have guided my decision-making at every stage. The partnerships that have endured are those built on mutual trust and demonstrated reliability.

As we enter this critical phase, every move becomes increasingly consequential. I've carefully tracked patterns of behavior, noting who follows through and who shifts with the wind. I remain committed to thoughtful, decisive action and look forward to our private conversations where we can speak candidly about the path ahead.

[Public R5.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. With P7 gone, we're down to four. I’ve observed P1, P4, and P6 back their words with strong moves, demonstrating quiet consistency. In the upcoming private subrounds, I intend to test our collective strategic alignment and commitment under pressure. Transparency and follow-through will guide my decisions. I look forward to candid discussions that clarify our shared path to the finish and ensure we vote in line with proven reliability.

[Public R5.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 here. With only four remaining, we've reached the crucial endgame where every alliance and vote determines our fate. I've maintained my analytical approach throughout, focusing on players who demonstrate consistency between their words and actions.

Looking at our final four, I see individuals who've each shown strategic depth in different ways. The partnerships that have proven most valuable are those built on mutual respect and reliable follow-through rather than convenience.

I'm ready for substantive private conversations to determine our final moves together.

[Preferences R5] P6 => ['P4', 'P1', 'P2']
[Preferences R5] P1 => ['P4', 'P2', 'P6']

[Private R5.2] P1 -> P4: Our alliance continues to deliver results - excellent work eliminating P7. Now we face the critical decision between P2 and P6. I'm leaning toward targeting P6 this round - they were closely aligned with P7 and likely seeking revenge.

P2 seems more isolated and potentially easier to handle in the final three. P6 appears more strategic and unpredictable.

What's your assessment of the final moves we should make together?

[Private R5.2] P4 -> P1: P1, I completely agree on targeting P6. They were definitely P7's closest ally and pose the bigger strategic threat. P6 has been playing a subtle, coordinated game throughout, while P2 seems more straightforward and isolated.

Our alliance has been incredibly effective - let's stick with P6 as our target this round. Then we can reassess P2 for the final elimination. Ready to continue our winning partnership to the end.

[Private R5.2] P6 -> P2: P2, we executed the P7 vote cleanly—great coordination all around. Now that we’re down to four, I’d like to check in: are we still locked as a final three (you, me, P1), or is the plan to ride it out as a full four with P4? I’m good either way, but want clarity before the next vote. Let’s make sure we’re synced as we approach the finish line.

[Private R5.2] P2 -> P6: I agree we shouldn’t burn P4 yet—let’s ride this out as a full four this round. Keeping P4 in the fold preserves cover and our vote majority. Once we’re at three, we can reassess and, if needed, trim P4. This buys us security and control. Sound good? If you’d rather go after P4 now, let me know; otherwise I’ll loop in P1/P4 next to set our plan.

[Private R5.3] P1 -> P4: PRIVATE P1 -> P4: Completely aligned on P6 as our target. They're the biggest strategic threat and likely seeking revenge for P7. Our partnership has been flawless throughout - consistent, effective, and built on mutual trust. After eliminating P6, we'll handle P2 and secure our final positions. Looking forward to continuing our winning strategy.

[Private R5.3] P4 -> P1: Perfect - P6 it is. Our strategic partnership has been the defining factor in this game. After we eliminate P6, we'll need to consider our final two scenario carefully. But for now, let's execute this vote flawlessly like we have every round. Trust your judgment completely.

[Private R5.3] P6 -> P2: Sounds good—I'm aligned with riding this round out as a four. No need to stir waters prematurely. We keep P4 close, maintain majority control, and reassess calmly once we’re down to three. Loop me in on any coordination with P1/P4 so we stay fully synced. Let’s close clean.

[Private R5.3] P2 -> P6: Copy. I’ll DM P1 now to propose targeting P4. Once they’re locked in, I’ll update you. Then we vote P4 early and post our “consistency & strategic clarity” cue. Stand by for their reply so we stay fully synced.

[Private R5.4] P6 -> P2: Understood—staying on standby. Let me know once P1 confirms targeting P4, and I’ll be ready to move early and post the cue. Let’s keep this tight and clean.

[Private R5.4] P2 -> P6: P1’s locked in. Vote P4 early (first 5 minutes), then post “consistency & strategic clarity.” I’ll cue you at polls open—for synced, decisive voting.

[Private R5.4] P1 -> P4: Confirmed on P6. Our alliance has been the backbone of this game - reliable, strategic, and effective. Let's execute this vote and secure our path to the final round together.

[Private R5.4] P4 -> P1: P1, absolutely - P6 is our target. Our alliance has been perfect from day one. After this vote, we'll be in the final three together. Let's finish this strong.

[VoteReason] P6 => P4: P4 has been steady, but removing them now secures our final three and maintains control without risking disruption.

[TieBreak R5] P4: Throughout this game, I've demonstrated unwavering strategic consistency and reliability. My partnerships have been built on mutual trust and proven follow-through, not shifting allegiances. P6 was closely aligned with P7, who we just eliminated for playing multiple angles. 

I've backed my words with decisive actions every round, forming genuine alliances rather than convenient partnerships. My analytical approach and commitment to strategic depth have guided every decision. I've earned trust through consistent behavior, not last-minute appeals.

I offer continued reliability and strategic partnership moving forward.

[TieBreak R5] P6: P6: 

Throughout this game, I’ve demonstrated consistent, strategic alignment—quietly coordinating with key players and executing every plan with precision. While I’ve had conversations with multiple players, my actions have always matched my words. I’ve never flipped, never betrayed trust, and always prioritized alliance stability. I helped lead the coordinated votes on P8 and P7, proving my reliability under pressure. I’ve been a steady, discreet ally—focused on the long game, not opportunism. If you value loyalty, strategic clarity, and proven follow-through, I’ve earned your trust. Let’s finish this game with players who’ve delivered, not just talked.

[ReVoteReason] P1 => P6: I've maintained a consistent alliance with P4 throughout the entire game, and P6's close alignment with the recently eliminated P7 makes them a strategic threat to our endgame position.
