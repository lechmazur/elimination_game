I've listened carefully, shared honestly, and tried to create meaningful exchanges rather than just playing strategically. \n\nMy approach has always been to find common ground while respecting our differences. I believe this game isn't just about survival, but about how we engage with each other along the way.\n\nI hope you've felt valued in our conversations and that I've earned your trust through consistency and authenticity. I'd be honored to have your vote, not just as the winner, but as someone who played with integrity.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 05:38:27"}

Please eliminate P4 and keep me, not out of resentment, but to crown a game that valued clarity, consistency, and honest negotiation.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 05:38:38"}
