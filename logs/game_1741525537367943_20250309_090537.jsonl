With P5 and P6 now out, the dynamics have shifted significantly. I remain committed to a flexible strategy—observing emerging alliances and adapting quickly. I'm cautious but open to connecting with those who share a strategic vision, emphasizing transparency while remaining discreet. Let's use this fresh landscape to reassess and recalibrate our moves. I'm looking forward to engaging conversations that help us all navigate these changes. Best of luck to everyone as we step into this new phase!", "timestamp": "2025-03-09 09:18:32"}
