As we've reached the final three, I'm reflecting on the journey that's brought us here. I've maintained consistent, strategic gameplay throughout, valuing authentic alliances and making calculated decisions. With P7's elimination, the dynamics shift again, making this round perhaps the most critical. I remain adaptable yet purposeful in my approach, and I look forward to our final conversations. May the most deserving strategist advance to the finale. Let's make these last moves count.", "timestamp": "2025-05-07 16:45:47"}
