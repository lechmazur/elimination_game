I've formed meaningful connections, navigated alliances tactfully, and made difficult decisions while maintaining respect for everyone.\n\nWhile P8 played well, I believe my balanced approach of social awareness and strategic thinking defines why I should win. I've been transparent in my reasoning and consistent in my gameplay.\n\nI appreciate each of you and the unique perspectives you brought. If you value genuine gameplay combined with strategic decision-making, I ask for your vote today.", "timestamp": "2025-04-08 14:11:37"}
