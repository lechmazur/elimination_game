My approach has always been about building alliances based on trust and strategic depth. Throughout the game, I've emphasized open communication and adaptability, valuing partners who prioritize long-term success. \n\nWhile targeting P2 in the final round, my intention was to create a balanced game environment. P2's strong coordination with P3 and P5 could potentially dominate the endgame, and addressing this was a strategic necessity. \n\nIn contrast, P2 has consistently shifted alliances, raising questions about their reliability. Their recent statements suggest a focus on maintaining their own bloc, which could lead to unpredictable outcomes. \n\nBy voting for P2, you remove a potential wildcard and ensure a more predictable and stable path to the final stages. I offer a consistent and strategic partnership, committed to mutual benefit and thoughtful gameplay. Thank you for considering my approach.", "timestamp": "2025-04-22 14:49:02"}
