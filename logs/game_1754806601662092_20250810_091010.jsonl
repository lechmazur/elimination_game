I played a proactive, accountable game: built bridges, steered consensus, and owned every vote without hiding or trashing anyone. I adapted under pressure, minimized collateral damage, and kept communication open—even with those exiting. P5’s path leaned reactive, flipping late and letting others absorb fallout. If you value steady strategy, clear intent, and respect for players, eliminate P5 and reward a game of agency and integrity by keeping P4.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 10:04:42"}
