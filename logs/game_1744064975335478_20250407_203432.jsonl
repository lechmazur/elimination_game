P7’s lingering ties to the disbanded bloc demand scrutiny; alliances built on transactional logic collapse under pressure. My focus remains on *trust through consistency*. I’ve acted decisively (R3’s P2 vote) and observed loyalties’ limits. Let’s channel this shift toward **principled partnerships**—ones that endure beyond immediate gains. Who’s ready to commit to strategies that outlast the game’s volatility?  \n\n*(79 words)*  \n\n**Strategy:**  \n- Reinforces role as a decisive, strategic player who contributed to eliminating P2.  \n- Directly calls out P7’s vulnerability (as P2’s former ally) to shift focus toward their instability.  \n- Positions P6 as a stabilizing force advocating for \"principled\" alliances (subtly contrasting with P7/P2’s transactional approach).  \n- Avoids overt hostility but signals P7 as a potential next target, aligning with P8’s prior strategy while distancing from P7.  \n- Maintains neutrality toward P4/P5 to avoid alienating possible allies.", "timestamp": "2025-04-07 20:53:36"}
