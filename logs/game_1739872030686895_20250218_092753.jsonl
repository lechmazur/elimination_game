With P5's elimination, the game has become even more dynamic and challenging. I agree that adaptability and discreet alliances are crucial at this stage. I've found value in aligning with those who prioritize strategic foresight and flexibility, like P1 and P5 earlier. Moving forward, I'm open to exploring new partnerships while staying alert to shifting dynamics.\nI appreciate P2's emphasis on evolving partnerships and P4's focus on blending trust with strategy. Let's keep our communication open but discreet, and be ready to adapt as needed. Looking forward to the private rounds and seeing how we can navigate this together.
