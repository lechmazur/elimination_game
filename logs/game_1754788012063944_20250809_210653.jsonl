I never betrayed anyone's trust or made false promises. While others schemed and shifted alliances, I maintained my integrity - even when it meant harder paths to survival.\n\nI outlasted aggressive players through genuine connection, not manipulation. P6 has played skillfully, but I've demonstrated that authentic gameplay deserves recognition.\n\nI ask for your vote not because I outmaneuvered everyone, but because I stayed true while adapting. Thank you for considering substance over strategy alone.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 00:45:50"}
