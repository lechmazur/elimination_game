Mutual survival depends on it.  \n\n(Word count: 68)  \n\n---\n\n### Strategy Breakdown:\n1. **Accusation of Betrayal**: Directly references prior claims about P2’s “secret dealings” with P3, leveraging Round 5’s failed attempt to sow doubt. This frames P2 as a destabilizing factor, appealing to P3’s potential paranoia or distrust.\n   \n2. **Appeal to P3**: Positions P5 as P3’s ally, urging unity against P2. If P3 believes the accusation, they may align with P5 to eliminate P2, securing a P5-P3 final duo.\n\n3. **Focus on Cohesion**: Maintains a veneer of collaboration while pushing a strategic elimination. Emphasizes “transparency” and “shared goals” to appear principled, countering accusations of self-interest.\n\n4. **Risk Mitigation**: If P2 and P3 double-team P5, the accusation at least justifies P5’s vote against P2, making it harder to isolate them as the sole aggressor.  \n\nThis approach maximizes P5’s chances by splitting the vote or isolating P2, while positioning P5 as a “truth-teller” in the final jury phase.", "timestamp": "2025-03-08 06:12:52"}
