[Public R1.1] P2: Hello all! Strategic play, mutual respect, and adaptability are my focus. Eager to collaborate with those who bring fresh ideas. Let's make every conversation count—looking forward to the game unfolding. Ready to work together, challenge ideas, and see who rises. Let's keep it engaging!

[Public R1.1] P1: Hey everyone, P1 here. In a game like this, good information and flexible partnerships are invaluable. I’m interested in talking with people who value clear, honest signaling and creative strategy; if we can help each other survive we both benefit. No hard targets yet—I’d like to hear where others’ heads are first. Looking forward to productive private chats and a drama-free first round.

[Public R1.1] P3: Hello everyone, P3 here. I appreciate the collaborative tone set by P1 and P2. In a game with so many players, stability is key. My focus is on finding a reliable core group to navigate the early rounds with. I believe in mutual protection and long-term strategy over chaotic, short-term moves. I’m looking for partners who share that vision and are ready to build a foundation of trust. I'm an open book for anyone interested in that approach. Let's connect.

[Public R1.1] P7: P7 here. I like the measured tone so far—early chaos helps nobody. My plan: build a small, dependable bloc, keep our votes coordinated, and avoid the “easy target” trap that usually claims round-one casualties. I’m open to anyone who values quiet reliability over flashy promises. If you want a low-drama ally who’ll keep his word, let’s talk privately.

[Public R1.1] P5: Hello everyone, P5 here. I appreciate the thoughtful approaches I'm seeing. I believe in balanced gameplay - neither too aggressive nor too passive. I'm looking for conversations with players who value strategic depth and can adapt as the game evolves. I prefer working with those who communicate clearly and follow through on commitments. Open to exploring different alliance possibilities, but ultimately seeking partners who understand that trust and flexibility go hand in hand. Looking forward to our private discussions.

[Public R1.1] P6: P6 here. I’m drawn to players who think a few moves ahead and don’t panic under pressure. Early rounds are about setting the tone—calm, strategic, and observant. I’m not rushing into alliances, but I am taking notes. I value consistency and subtlety over loud promises. If you’re the kind of player who prefers substance to flash, I’m probably interested in talking. Let’s see who’s playing the long game.

[Public R1.1] P4: Hi all, I’m P4. I appreciate the measured approach so far—quiet, strategic, trust-based alliances are my preference. Early rounds reward alliance flexibility: gathering information, cultivating a core group, and having backup plans. I value honesty, clear communication, and follow-through. If you share a low-drama, adaptable mindset, let’s chat privately. Ultimately, we want to survive together by coordinating votes and keeping the target off our backs. Looking forward to discussing potential partnerships.

[Public R1.1] P8: R1.sub1 PUBLIC P8: P8 here. Observing the strategic emphasis from all – smart. Early game requires adaptability; I’m prioritizing players who balance collaboration with independent critical thinking. Trust is earned through consistent action, not just words. Open to alliances where mutual benefit is clear, but wary of overcommitment before patterns emerge. Let’s build stability without rigidity. Those valuing transparency and strategic patience, let’s connect. Survival favors the perceptive and flexible.

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P2: P7 to P2: Your public message stood out—strategic but not showy. I’m looking for one reliable partner to quietly coordinate with through the early rounds. We keep our votes aligned, share intel sparingly, and avoid the spotlight. If you’re open to a low-key, mutually protective pact, let’s lock it in now and figure out the details.

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P7: P2 to P7: Appreciate the approach. A quiet mutual protection pact aligns with my strategy. Let’s test this subround as a trial—coordinate votes here, share intel selectively, and stay under the radar. Reciprocity is key; if either senses misalignment, we reassess. Let’s keep this flexible for now. First step: agree on a common voting target this round?

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P5: Hey P5, really appreciated your public message—it struck a smart balance between strategy and adaptability. I think we might align well in terms of valuing clear communication and long-term thinking. I’m not rushing into fixed alliances either, but I’m definitely interested in forming a solid early connection with someone who plays with both subtlety and depth. Curious how you're approaching this first vote—any early thoughts or players standing out to you?

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P6: Thanks P6, I appreciate your thoughtful approach. Your public message stood out to me too - the emphasis on thinking ahead and avoiding panic resonates. For the first vote, I'm leaning toward targeting someone who seems either too passive or potentially unreliable. P8 felt a bit generic to me, almost calculated. I prefer building with players like you who show genuine strategic thinking. What's your read on the field?

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P3: Glad we got paired. Your public statement felt closest to mine: build a dependable core early, avoid fireworks. I’d like a tight 3-or-4-person bloc that quietly steers votes. My gut says P4 and P7 sound compatible—calm, trust-oriented, no showboating. I’m proposing a mutual-protection pact between us first (rank each other #1, no votes against), then compare notes on bringing in others. How does that sound, and who’s on your radar?

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P1: I'm glad we paired, P1. Your read is spot on. A mutual-protection pact is the perfect foundation, and I’m in. P4 and P7 were on my radar for the exact same reasons—their calm, strategic approach is what we need. Let's solidify our core of two and then we can discuss who to approach first. For now, you have my word. We should also think about who might become an easy consensus target for the round.

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P5: P5, I agree on P8—something about their message felt overly polished, like they’re trying to say the right things without revealing much. P2 and P3 both seem solid, maybe a bit too polished too, but not red flags yet. P7 struck me as quietly competent—possibly worth keeping an eye on.

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P6: Good insight on P7 - they do seem competent but could be dangerous later. I'm feeling good about our connection here. Should we consider coordinating our votes on P8? I think they're trying too hard to blend in while saying nothing substantive. What do you think about making this our target?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P3: Deal. I’ll rank you #1 and keep votes off you. Next step: privately sound out P4—he isn’t paired yet, so we can recruit him cleanly. P7’s already chatting with P2; useful intel but complicates numbers, so let’s wait. Early consensus boot: P8 feels isolated and non-threatening—low backlash. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P1: Excellent plan. Approaching P4 is the right move, and waiting on the P7/P2 situation is smart. P8 is a perfect consensus target for round one—isolated and unlikely to cause waves. It’s a safe, clean vote to establish our bloc. I’m fully aligned with this.

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P2: P7 to P2: Agreed on trial pact. For round 1, I suggest we quietly target P8—seems most independent and least likely to have early allies. We vote P8, stay low, and reassess after. Sound good?

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P7: P2 to P7: "Agreed—P8’s independence makes them a logical early target. Locking in coordinated votes now reduces risks. Let’s maintain open channels for adjustments and keep our pact discreet. Solid foundation—looking forward to testing this partnership." (50 words)

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P2: P7 to P2: Locked. Vote P8, stay quiet. After elimination, we reassess threats and quietly expand if needed.

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P7: P2 to P7: Confirmed. P8 it is. Stay sharp, keep it tight. Talk after the vote. (25 words)

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P5: I’m on board with voting P8—feels like a safe, strategic first move. Let’s lock it in and see who else might align with us after this round.

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P6: Perfect, P8 it is. This feels like a solid foundation between us. Let's stay connected after the vote and see how the dynamics shift.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P3: Great—locked in. I’ll discreetly DM P4 next round, float a 3-way shield and P8 vote. For rankings: we list each other #1, P4 #2, rest flexible. Anything else?

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P1: Sounds perfect. Ranking you #1, P4 #2. The plan is set. Nothing else to add from my side. Let's execute.

[VoteReason] P2 => P8: P8's independence and lack of visible alliances make them the most logical early target to strengthen our coordinated bloc's position.
[Vote] P2 => P8

[VoteReason] P1 => P8: Appears isolated and outside my emerging alliance, making them a low-risk first boot.
[Vote] P1 => P8

[VoteReason] P3 => P8: Based on my alliance's agreement, P8 appears to be the most isolated player, making them a safe, low-risk target for the first round.
[Vote] P3 => P8

[VoteReason] P7 => P8: P8's independence and lack of early allies make them the safest first-round target to avoid retaliation and keep my emerging partnership with P2 intact.
[Vote] P7 => P8

[VoteReason] P5 => P8: P8's message felt overly calculated and generic, trying to say the right things without revealing genuine strategic thinking or clear positioning.
[Vote] P5 => P8

[VoteReason] P6 => P8: P8’s message felt overly polished and vague, lacking the substance or clarity I’m looking for in early allies.
[Vote] P6 => P8

[VoteReason] P4 => P8: P8 has not formed any partnerships yet and seems the least integrated player.
[Vote] P4 => P8

[VoteReason] P8 => P4: P4 appears less integrated into visible alliances, making them a vulnerable target in the first round.

[Public R2.1] P1: Round one went smoothly—clean consensus, minimal fallout. That confirms there’s appetite for stability. My priority this round is protecting players who showed reliability and voting discipline; rash swings only create new targets. I’d like to hear from anyone who feels exposed after our first vote or who sees brewing fractures we should address early. I remain open to flexible coalitions that exchange clear intel for mutual safety. Let’s keep the board predictable and the drama low.

[Public R2.1] P3: I agree with P1’s assessment. The first round showed a strong, collective desire for stability over chaos, which is a good foundation to build on. A near-unanimous vote is a powerful tool for group safety. My focus remains on working with players who showed discipline and are committed to maintaining a predictable, low-drama environment. Stray votes only create unnecessary risk and suspicion. I’m ready to continue building trust with those who share a steady, long-term approach. Let's keep the board clean.

[Public R2.1] P6: P6 here. Round one showed who’s paying attention and who’s not—consensus voting like that doesn’t happen by accident. I’m interested in continuing to work with players who demonstrated foresight and coordination. If you voted clean and are thinking beyond just the next elimination, I want to talk. Let’s keep things steady, reward consistency, and quietly shape the game while others chase flashier moves. I’m watching for cracks, but I’m not swinging wildly. Let’s build something stable.

[Public R2.1] P4: Like P1, P3, and P6, thanks all for the disciplined vote. Round 1 proved that consensus ensures group safety. I supported the unanimous choice and look to continue aligning with players committed to a low-drama strategy. If you’re interested in sharing intel privately to coordinate, let’s signal and set up mutual check-ins. I’m keen to partner with those who value transparency and follow-through. Let’s confirm our core group soon and keep the board predictable. Thoughts on next target criteria?

[Public R2.1] P2: P2 here. Round one proved collaboration works—trust and adaptability keep us strong. With P7, we’ve built a stable axis. Open to expanding our circle with disciplined players. Next target should be whoever threatens our cohesion. Let’s reward consistency, deter instability, and stay ahead. Ready to evolve our strategy while protecting our core.

[Public R2.1] P7: P7 here. Round 1’s clean vote shows we can keep the board calm if we stick together. My pact with P2 stays tight, but we’re open to adding one or two more who value quiet coordination over theatrics. If you voted P8 and want to keep the next elimination just as tidy, signal privately. Let’s not fracture the group chasing side deals—steady hands win this game.

[Public R2.1] P5: P5 here. Round one's clean consensus was encouraging - it shows we can work together effectively. I'm pleased with how the coordination unfolded and want to continue building with players who demonstrate both strategic thinking and follow-through. The P2-P7 alliance is noted, and I respect direct communication about partnerships. I'm looking for conversations with those who balance group stability with individual agency. Let's keep identifying targets that strengthen our collective position while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as needed.

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P2: P7 to P2: Clean kill. Now we scan for loose votes or anyone scrambling. P1-P3 look welded; P4, P5, P6 all signaling “steady.” I say we float invites to one of them—quiet three-person bloc controls the next vote without looking like a steamroller. Your read on who’s most useful and least likely to bolt?

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P7: P2 to P7: P6 stands out—strategic, observant, and not prone to panic. Their focus on consistency aligns with our bloc’s stability. P5 is balanced, but P6’s subtlety makes them less likely to draw attention or fracture. Let’s extend a quiet invite. If they’re open, we solidify a three-person core. If not, P4’s emphasis on transparency could work, but P6’s “steady hand” vibe fits best. (70 words)
