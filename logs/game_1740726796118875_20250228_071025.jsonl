I agreed with P6's assessment of P2, P5, and P8 as potential allies and suggested protecting allies in voting.\n\nNow, in this short message, I should:\n1. **Acknowledge P6's inclusion of P1 and P3.**  This shows I'm listening and considering their perspective.\n2. **Reinforce the idea of protecting our group in voting.**  This solidifies our potential alliance.\n3. **Subtly prompt P6 to think about *who* to vote for without being too direct or aggressive this early.**  Maybe ask if anyone is standing out negatively.\n\nDrafting a few options:\n\nOption 1 (Direct but slightly long): \"P1 and P3 are good additions.  Let's definitely protect our group in voting.  Any initial thoughts on who seems less aligned with us for voting?\" (30 words, a bit pushy on voting targets)\n\nOption 2 (Slightly softer): \"Yes, P1 and P3 could work. Protecting our group makes sense for voting.  Anyone standing out *negatively* yet?\" (24 words, softer and more suggestive)\n\nOption 3 (Too short and vague): \"Agree on P1 and P3.  Protect allies in voting. Who to vote?\" (13 words, too abrupt)\n\nOption 2 seems like the best balance. It's concise, friendly, and moves the conversation forward without being overly demanding.  It subtly prompts P6 to consider voting targets by asking about negative standouts, which aligns with P6's earlier comment about voting for less transparent players.\n\nI will go with Option 2.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nP7: \"Yes, P1 and P3 could work.
