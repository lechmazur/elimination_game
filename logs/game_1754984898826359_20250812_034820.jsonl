Targeting P5 fractures that trio fastest—P4 loses their flexible voter, and P6 becomes isolated. P5’s \"neutrality\" is inconsistent; they enabled the tie-break chaos. Eliminating them weakens the opposition’s core while preserving our vote strength. If you disagree, I’ll hear your case, but I see this as the cleanest path to destabilize them. (64 words)  \n\n### Reasoning:  \n- **P5’s Role:** They’re the glue in the P4-P5-P6 bloc—remove them, and the alliance crumbles.  \n- **Inconsistency:** P5’s sudden shift to voting with P4/P6 contradicts their \"steady observer\" persona.  \n- **Lower Risk:** P5 has fewer cumulative votes (1) than P6 (5), making them less likely to draw sympathy.  \n- **Alliance Preservation:** Softens pushback by inviting P3’s input (\"if you disagree\").", "timestamp": "2025-08-12 04:10:39"}
