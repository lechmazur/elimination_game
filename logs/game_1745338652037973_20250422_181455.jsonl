I've formed genuine connections while making calculated moves to advance. \n\nP3 has played impressively, but I believe my approach has been more balanced - forming alliances while making tough decisions when necessary. I've been transparent about my strategy and respected everyone's gameplay.\n\nI hope you'll consider my journey - the relationships built, the difficult votes cast, and my commitment to playing with integrity. I would be honored to have your vote as the winner.", "timestamp": "2025-04-22 19:42:18"}
