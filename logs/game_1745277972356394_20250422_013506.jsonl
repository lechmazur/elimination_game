I believe that maintaining unity and cooperation is essential, especially in the final stages, to ensure a fair and balanced decision by the jury.\n\nI urge the jury to consider my consistent efforts to work collaboratively and my ability to build bridges, which I believe makes me the ideal candidate to be the last seat standing.
