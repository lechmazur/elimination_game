I respected every alliance and made decisions for the group's benefit, not just my own. P3, however, prioritized short-term gains over trust, fracturing relationships that could have united us. I’ve earned your respect through consistency—vote to eliminate P3 and keep me, P5. Let’s crown a winner who values loyalty and deserves this victory. Thank you.\"", "timestamp": "2025-08-12 05:33:43"}
