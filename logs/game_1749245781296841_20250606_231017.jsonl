Throughout our conversations, I sought real connections while making calculated moves when necessary. I respected everyone's position, even when voting strategies differed.\n\nWhile P5 certainly deserves credit for reaching the Final 2, I believe my balanced approach of genuine interaction and strategic thinking represents the spirit of this game. I've been consistent, transparent about my reasoning, and remained adaptable as the dynamics shifted.\n\nI ask for your vote not just for my gameplay, but for the authentic relationships we built along the way.", "timestamp": "2025-06-06 23:33:07"}
