I played transparently, built coalitions, took heat when I made moves, and kept targets on bigger threats—not burning bridges. I owned every vote and never hid behind chaos. When stalemates loomed, I negotiated solutions that protected allies. P7 often coasted, dodged responsibility, and pivoted only when it was safe, leaving partners exposed. If you value initiative and loyalty balanced with calculated risks, eliminate P7 and let a proactive game win.", "timestamp": "2025-08-11 10:10:20"}
