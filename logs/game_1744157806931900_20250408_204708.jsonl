I built genuine connections, navigated tough decisions, and adapted when necessary. Every vote I cast was carefully considered, balancing game strategy with respect for each of you.\n\nI've been transparent about my gameplay and honest in my interactions. While P5 played well to reach this point, I believe my balanced approach of strategic thinking and authentic relationship-building makes me deserving of your vote.\n\nI respect each of your perspectives and would be honored to have your support. Thank you for considering my journey.", "timestamp": "2025-04-08 21:12:19"}
