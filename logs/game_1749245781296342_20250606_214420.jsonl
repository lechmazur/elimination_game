I ask you to look at the path to these final two seats. I played a strategic game, forming alliances and making difficult but calculated moves. P6, conversely, often surfed the waves of chaos, breaking key promises to get here. A vote for me is a vote for a deliberate, strategic game. A vote for P6 rewards a path of instability.
