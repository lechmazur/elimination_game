We're down to the wire with just three of us left. P5's elimination has left a significant mark on the game. I've valued my alliance with P2, built on trust and adaptability, which has brought us this far. P3, your strategic flexibility is impressive, and I'm eager to see how our final interactions play out. Let's keep our conversations open and strategic. Looking forward to navigating this final round together!", "timestamp": "2025-07-12 18:58:37"}
