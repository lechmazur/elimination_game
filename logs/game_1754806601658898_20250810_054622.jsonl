Round 2 presents fascinating new dynamics after P8's elimination demonstrated the risks of pure disruption tactics.\n\nI appreciate P2 and P5's interest in collaboration - your strategic thinking impressed me last round. The game rewards adaptability, and I'm open to exploring alliances with players who balance genuine partnership with realistic competitive awareness.\n\nP6 and P7's continued coordination shows consistency. P1 and P4 remain intriguing wildcards.\n\nI'm seeking partners who think beyond immediate survival - players ready for substantive strategy conversations that acknowledge both cooperation opportunities and elimination realities.\n\nLet's build something sustainable this round.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 06:26:22"}
