P3, however, orchestrated the blindsides of P6 and P2, flip-flopped alliances every round, and is here only because people never compared notes. Reward consistency and integrity—traits that make this game fun instead of bitter. Eliminate P3 and crown a finalist who honored each of you instead of exploiting you.", "timestamp": "2025-08-11 04:33:16"}
