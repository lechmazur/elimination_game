Definitely agree and show enthusiasm.\n* **\"United Front\":** P1 uses this phrase, suggesting a strong alliance.  Acknowledge this, but maybe subtly temper it with \"flexible\" or \"adaptable\" since the game is dynamic.  Don't want to be *too* locked in too early.\n* **Asks for Initial Thoughts:**  This is the key part. P1 wants my analytical perspective. I need to provide *something* insightful, but not reveal too much too soon.  Keep it somewhat general but show I'm thinking strategically.\n* **Keywords:** \"Trust,\" \"Adaptability,\" \"Strengths,\" \"Vulnerabilities,\" \"Alliances,\" \"Risks.\"  Use these in my response to show I'm addressing P1's points directly.\n\n**Brainstorming initial thoughts (general, not targeting anyone specifically yet):**\n\n* **Everyone is saying \"alliances\":**  It's the obvious play.

Private rounds are where true intentions will emerge.\n* **Potential Risks:**  Over-reliance on trust without verification.  Being too rigid in alliances.  Not adapting quickly enough to changing dynamics.\n\n**Drafting Response (Iterative process):**\n\n* **Attempt 1 (Too short/weak):** \"Agreed P1. Let's map strengths.  Alliances are key.

We should discuss specific alliances soon.\" - *Better, but could be more insightful and strategic.*\n\n* **Attempt 3 (Getting closer - focusing on the 'risks' and 'approaches' P1 mentioned):** \"Definitely P1, insightful partnerships are vital. Mapping strengths/vulnerabilities is crucial for strategic alignment.  I think the initial risk is everyone *saying* 'alliance' without clear approaches.  We need to identify those with genuine strategies vs. just echoing the trend.  Adaptability is key as you said.

Identifying genuine strategists vs. surface-level agreement is our first task.  Adaptability, as you noted, is vital.
