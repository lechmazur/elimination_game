The P1-P6 bloc is clearly established, which creates interesting dynamics for independent players. P8 and I found common ground in recognizing early power consolidation risks. Moving forward, I'm seeking partners who think critically rather than following momentum. P7 and P5's analytical approaches resonate with me. Let's avoid predictable bloc voting patterns and keep the game competitive.
