With P1's elimination, it's crucial we maintain our unity and strategic coordination. Our core alliance—P3, P4, P6, and P8—has proven effective, and I'm committed to upholding that trust. Transparency and clear communication will guide our decisions moving forward. Let’s continue to prioritize private discussions to assess potential threats and align our strategies. Together, we can navigate this round wisely and ensure our mutual survival. Looking forward to our private conversations to refine our plans and keep our alliance strong. Good luck to all!", "timestamp": "2025-04-20 22:09:19"}
