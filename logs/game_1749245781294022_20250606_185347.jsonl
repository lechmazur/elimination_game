We're in the final four - what an intense journey it's been. With P4's elimination, the dynamics have shifted dramatically once again. \n\nI've consistently focused on building authentic partnerships based on trust and strategic alignment. Looking at who remains, I see players who've all demonstrated strong tactical thinking and adaptability. At this stage, every conversation and decision is crucial.\n\nI'm committed to playing with both integrity and smart strategy as we approach the endgame.
