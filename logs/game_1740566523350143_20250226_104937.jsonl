I've been straightforward, honest, and strategic without betrayal. I've navigated conversations with curiosity and respect, seeking to understand your perspectives while sharing my own authentic thoughts.\n\nRather than promising alliances I couldn't keep, I've focused on meaningful exchanges. My strategy has been consistent: form real connections, communicate clearly, and make decisions with integrity.\n\nI ask for your vote not because P4 doesn't deserve it, but because I believe my balanced approach to both social and strategic elements represents the spirit of this game.", "timestamp": "2025-02-26 11:15:42"}
