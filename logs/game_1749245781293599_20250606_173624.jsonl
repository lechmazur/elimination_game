Throughout this game, I've navigated complex alliances, brokered peace, and made tough decisions to ensure my survival. My opponent, while formidable, has demonstrated a more rigid approach to the game, often relying on strength of argument over the finesse of negotiation. I ask you to consider not just who has played the game well, but who has played it with integrity, flexibility, and a genuine desire to engage with each of you on your terms. Vote to keep me, and you're not just rewarding strategy; you're endorsing a spirit of collaboration and mutual respect that has defined my journey here.", "timestamp": "2025-06-06 18:11:37"}
