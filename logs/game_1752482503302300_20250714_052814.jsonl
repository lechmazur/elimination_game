As we enter this pivotal Round 6, I want to emphasize the importance of strategic alliances and clear communication. Our journey so far has shown that understanding each other's goals and maintaining transparency are key to success. I've been in discussions with P3, and we both agree that forming a strong alliance is crucial in this final phase.\n\nI'm open to aligning with P7, as they also value open dialogue and collaboration. Let's use our private conversations to solidify our strategies and ensure our votes are coordinated. My goal is to navigate this round with integrity, fostering alliances that benefit all involved. Looking forward to working together and achieving a positive outcome for our group. Good luck to all!", "timestamp": "2025-07-14 06:19:30"}
