I’m doubling down on dependable reciprocity. P4/P3/P1: I propose mutual top-3 and no-vote pacts again; I’ll mirror. P2, your originality lens fits our approach—open to coordinate if we set concrete signals (rank order, vote + backup). For elimination, I favor consistency: protect steady collaborators; scrutinize sudden pivots or derivative bandwagons. I’ll share my exact ballot in privates and won’t switch without notice.
