I've consistently engaged with each of you genuinely - whether discussing philosophy with P8, culture with P6, creativity with P5, or building trust with P7, P4, and P1.\n\nP2 has played brilliantly, but I've balanced both social bonds and strategic awareness throughout. I've never betrayed anyone's trust directly, and I've tried to make this experience meaningful for everyone involved.\n\nI respect whatever decision you make, and thank you for this incredible journey together.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 14:58:21"}
