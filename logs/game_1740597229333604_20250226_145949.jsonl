While P5 played fiercely, my integrity and adaptability kept me grounded. I navigated challenges not just to survive, but to honor the bonds we built—including with many of you. This game rewards strategy, but also character. I ask for your vote not as a plea, but as a testament to the respect and fairness I’ve upheld. Let the winner reflect the values we shared. Thank you.\"", "timestamp": "2025-02-26 16:02:38"}
