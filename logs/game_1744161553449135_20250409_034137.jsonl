With P7's elimination, our game landscape has shifted significantly. I value the strong partnership I've built with P5 based on mutual trust and strategic alignment.\n\nI'm noticing evolving alliance patterns among us and remain adaptable to these dynamics. P2's independent approach has caught my attention, and I'm open to expanding collaborative relationships.\n\nTo those who've formed different alliances—I respect your strategies while remaining vigilant. Let's engage thoughtfully as we navigate this critical juncture together.\n\nI look forward to our private conversations and building meaningful connections this round.", "timestamp": "2025-04-09 03:52:17"}
