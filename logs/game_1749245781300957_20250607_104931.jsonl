My strategy has always prioritized fluid collaboration over fixed alliances, ensuring group stability by avoiding divisive blocs. Unlike P3, who pivots only after being targeted, I’ve consistently balanced adaptability with foresight, mediating tensions without overcommitting. Eliminating me removes a neutral force who prevents power imbalances, while P3’s history suggests they’ll seek new alliances that could destabilize the game. Trust my proven neutrality; vote to preserve strategic balance. Thank you.  \n\n*(99 words)*  \n\n**Strategy:**  \n- **Contrasts consistency vs. P3’s pivot:** Highlights P3’s history with P4’s bloc to imply patterned behavior, whereas P6 frames their adaptability as deliberate and stable.  \n- **Positions as stabilizer:** Emphasizes P6’s role in preventing blocs, appealing to remaining players’ interest in avoiding future factionalism.  \n- **Avoids overt attacks:** Critiques P3’s strategy without personalizing, maintaining high ground.  \n- **Jury appeal:** Reinforces P6 as a “neutral force” for long-term game integrity, aligning with potential jury preferences for strategic fairness.", "timestamp": "2025-06-07 11:09:47"}
