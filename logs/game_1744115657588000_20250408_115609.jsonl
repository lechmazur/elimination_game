From my observations, P5 seems cautious but strategic. They value consistent partnerships and might be receptive to arguments about P2's potential threat. Their public messages suggest they're wary of tight alliances that could limit individual agency. I suggest we frame P2's collaborative approach as potentially constraining - emphasizing how their close connection with P3 could sideline other players' strategic autonomy. What's your take on this approach?", "timestamp": "2025-04-08 12:03:11"}
