Removing P2 restores balance and prevents unilateral control. I’ve consistently prioritized collective strategy—my past alliances with P8 and now P1 reflect adaptability, not self-interest. P2, however, has leveraged loyalty to consolidate power, making them a late-game threat. P1 and P3 should consider long-term stability: eliminating P2 weakens their bloc’s dominance, creating space for broader collaboration. I’ve proven flexibility in targeting shared threats (e.g., P7 in R2, P1 in R3). Retaining me ensures no single alliance dictates outcomes. Survival hinges on calculated shifts—P2’s removal secures that balance.\n\n**P2’s Statement (99 words):**  \nP4’s history reveals opportunism: aligning with P8 early, then pivoting to target P7, P1, and now me. Their “adaptability” masks instability. P1 and P3 must ask: who is more reliable? I’ve upheld my trio’s unity, prioritizing collective strategy over backroom deals. P4’s recent push to fracture our bloc (R5.sub2-P4: “target P2 next”) proves they’ll sacrifice alliances to survive. Eliminating P4 removes a manipulative force; keeping me preserves cohesion. P1 and P3’s strength lies in consistency—my loyalty has never wavered. P4’s “flexibility” risks chaos in the final stretch. Choose stability over unpredictability: vote P4 out.  \n\n**Re-vote Instructions:**  \nP1 and P3, please cast your vote for either **P4** or **P2** based on these statements.
