[Public R1.1] P3: As P3, I’m here to play strategically and observe carefully. This early stage is crucial for gathering information about everyone’s intentions and behaviors. I’ll assess who seems trustworthy, who might be a threat, and who could be a valuable ally. Let’s keep the conversation open and productive—collaboration can help us all survive longer. I’m cautious but willing to engage with anyone ready to share their thoughts openly. Who else values strategy over chaos? Let’s find common ground while staying sharp!

[Public R1.1] P5: As P5, I’m here to play smart and build alliances. Early on, trust is key, but so is caution. I’ll be observing everyone’s moves closely to see who’s genuine and who’s playing a different game. Collaboration can help us all survive longer, but we need to stay sharp and strategic. I’m open to working with those who value thoughtful play over chaos. Let’s keep the conversation constructive and find ways to outlast the rest. Who’s ready to strategize together?

[Public R1.1] P1: As P1, I agree with P3 and P5 – strategy is key.  I'm also here to play smart and observe carefully.  Beyond initial plans, I value adaptability most.  The best strategies are dynamic, not fixed. I'm looking to connect with players who can think on their feet and adjust their approach as we learn more about each other.  Who else values dynamic strategy?

[Public R1.1] P2: As P2, I appreciate the focus on strategy and observation that others have mentioned. However, I think we should also consider the social dynamics at play. Building genuine connections, even in a competitive setting, can be as valuable as pure strategy. I'm looking for allies who can balance both tactical thinking and authentic interaction. Let's create meaningful partnerships while staying aware of the game's competitive nature. Who else believes in this balanced approach?

[Public R1.1] P4: As P4, I resonate with the emphasis on strategy and adaptability highlighted by P1, P3, and P5. Additionally, P2's point about social dynamics is crucial; genuine connections can indeed be a strategic asset. I aim to form alliances that are both tactically sound and socially enriching. Let's navigate this game with a blend of sharp strategy and meaningful interactions. Who's interested in a partnership that values both winning and the journey there?

Let’s work together to outlast the competition while fostering a collaborative environment. Who else values this balanced approach to the game?

[Public R1.1] P7: As P7, I'm aligned with the prevailing sentiment: strategy, adaptability, and social dynamics are all vital. I'm particularly interested in how others plan to *demonstrate* trustworthiness, not just claim it. Actions speak louder than words, especially in a game of elimination. I'll be watching for consistency between stated intentions and actual behavior. Who's willing to show, not just tell, their strategic approach and commitment to building genuine alliances? Let's see those cards.

[Public R1.1] P8: As P8, I appreciate the thoughtful insights shared by everyone. Strategy, adaptability, and genuine connections are indeed crucial.

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P5: R1.sub1 PRIVATE P3 to P5: P5, I appreciate your focus on trust and strategy. It seems we share similar approaches—observing carefully while staying adaptable. I value genuine collaboration but remain cautious about hidden motives. If we align our intentions and demonstrate consistency in our actions, we could form a strong alliance. Are you open to working together strategically while keeping each other accountable? Let’s exchange thoughts openly here and build mutual trust step by step.

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P3: P3, I agree—our approaches align well. Trust is essential, but so is vigilance. I’m open to forming a strategic alliance with you, provided we maintain transparency and accountability. Let’s share insights and observations to navigate this game effectively. I’ll keep an eye on others’ intentions and signal if I sense any threats. If we stay consistent and communicate openly, we can outlast the competition. Let’s build this partnership carefully.

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P6: Hey P6, I noticed you echoed my sentiment about balancing strategy with authentic connections. I appreciate that alignment. I think we could work well together since we both value this dual approach. What are your thoughts on the other players? I'm particularly curious about P7's challenge about demonstrating trustworthiness - maybe we could show that through consistent mutual support?

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "I agree, P2. Balancing strategy with genuine connections is key, and I think we share a similar mindset. P7's challenge is intriguing—demonstrating trustworthiness through actions is crucial. I'm open to supporting each other consistently. Regarding others, P3 and P5 seem strategic but cautious, while P1 and P4 emphasize adaptability. P8 also values transparency. Let's stay vigilant and build a strong alliance."

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P7: Hey P7, I appreciated your point about demonstrating trustworthiness through actions.  I agree, talk is cheap.  For me, dynamic strategy in action means being adaptable and responsive as things unfold. How do you plan to show your strategic approach in these early rounds?  I'm keen to see how you'll demonstrate your commitment to alliances too. Let's discuss.

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P1: P1, I'm glad you picked up on that. Early on, *showing* means being consistent and transparent. I'll openly share my reasoning behind votes, and I expect the same in return. For alliances, it means clear communication and *not* withholding crucial info. My strategic approach? Observing voting patterns closely. Discrepancies between words and votes will be a major red flag for me. What about you? How will *you* show adaptability?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P8: P8, I'm glad we're paired up. I value your focus on demonstrating strategy through actions, which aligns with my approach of blending sharp tactics with meaningful connections. Let's use this round to lay the groundwork for a strong alliance. What specific actions do you propose we take to build trust and showcase our strategic commitment? I'm eager to hear your thoughts and collaborate closely.

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P4: P8: "P4, I appreciate your approach and am excited to collaborate. To build trust, I suggest we share insights on our initial observations and identify common goals. We can propose forming a core alliance with P1 and P6, who also value strategic and genuine interactions. By aligning our actions and maintaining open communication, we can demonstrate our commitment to both strategy and collaboration. Let's also be mindful of the voting round, ensuring we support each other's plans. Your thoughts?"

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P8: P8, I agree with your proposal to share observations and align with P1 and P6. Let's focus on transparent communication and mutual support in voting. I'll start by sharing that I see P3 as a potential threat due to their strategic focus. Your insights?

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P4: P8: "I concur with your view on P3 as a potential threat. My observations suggest P3 might prioritize strategy over alliances, which could be risky. Let's ensure P1 and P6 are on board with our plan. For voting, we should aim to eliminate P3 if they don't align with us. Transparency and mutual support will be our strength. Thoughts on this approach?"

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P6: I appreciate your detailed player analysis. I agree about P7's directness - it makes them interesting but potentially threatening. What if we demonstrate our trustworthiness by sharing information about other private conversations we have? That way we can build trust while staying informed about others' moves.

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "Sharing private conversation info is risky but could build trust. Let's start with minor details to test the waters. I'm wary of P7's directness too—they might be a strong player. For now, let's focus on discreetly sharing insights and supporting each other. Agreed?"

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P7: ```
I'll show adaptability by reacting to new info and voting patterns. My strategy will evolve as we learn more.  Transparency is key for me too - I'll explain my strategic shifts as they happen.
```

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P1: Okay, P1. Shared reasoning behind votes is a must. Let's commit to that *after* the first vote. Before then, what's one *specific* thing you'll be looking for in someone's public statements or private chats to gauge their trustworthiness, besides voting patterns, which we can't see yet?

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P5: P3: "P5, transparency and accountability resonate with me. Let’s actively share observations about others’ behaviors and intentions. If we align our strategies and remain vigilant, we can build a strong, trustworthy alliance. I’m committed to this partnership—let’s ensure our actions consistently reflect our words. Together, we can outlast the competition."

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P3: P3, I’m fully committed to this alliance. Let’s focus on identifying potential threats and aligning our strategies to counter them. I’ll share any concerning observations I have about others’ moves. Consistency and mutual support will be key—let’s ensure our partnership remains strong and adaptable as the game progresses.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P5: P3: "Agreed, P5. Let’s stay sharp, share intel, and act decisively. Trust but verify—our consistency will set us apart. Together, we’ll outlast them all."

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P3: "P3, let’s solidify our alliance by identifying key threats early. I’ll monitor P7 and P8—they seem strategic. Share your insights, and we’ll act as one. Trust and vigilance will guide us."

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P7: ```
I'll watch for clear, direct answers and consistent messaging across public and private.
```

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P1: Good. I'm looking for the same. Let's compare notes on who *doesn't* meet that standard after the first vote. Agreed? We'll share reasoning openly, as promised.

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P8: P8, I'm on board with targeting P3. Let's solidify our alliance with P1 and P6. Transparency and strategic alignment are key. Ready to move forward?

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P4: P8: "Agreed, P4. Let's ensure P1 and P6 are aligned. I'll reach out to them to confirm our strategy and voting plan. We must remain transparent and cohesive to succeed."

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P6: Agreed on being discreet. Let's protect each other in the vote and maybe target P7 - their directness could rally others against us. Keep me updated on any crucial info.

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "Let's proceed with caution. I'll share any intel I get. For now, discreetly support each other and keep an eye on P7. Trust is key."

Ensuring everyone is on the same page will be crucial for our success. I'll take the initiative to reach out to P1 and P6. Let's focus on maintaining transparency and cohesion. Are you available to coordinate this?"

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P8: P8, I'm fully on board with your plan to meet with P1 and P6. Let's ensure our alliance remains strong and focused on eliminating P3. I'm available to coordinate whenever you set up the meeting. Transparency and strategic alignment will keep us ahead. Let's do this!

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "I've been watching P3 and P5 closely—they seem tightly aligned and could be a strong force. P8 and P4's open alliance might make them vulnerable despite their transparency. For now, let's keep our alliance discreet and continue sharing insights. We should stay flexible and adapt as new information comes in. Let's keep our communication secure and focused on outmaneuvering potential threats."

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P6: I agree that P3-P5 and P8-P4-P1 are the main alliance blocks to watch. Their openness about alliances could make them vulnerable, but also shows they're confident in their numbers. We should consider approaching P1 - they seem most flexible within their group. For now, let's maintain our discreet partnership and gather more intel about others' private conversations. What have you learned from your other chats?

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P5: P3: "P5, our alliance is solid, but we must act decisively. I’ve noticed P8 and P4 openly declaring their alliance—they’re confident but exposed. Let’s exploit this by sowing doubt subtly while reinforcing our consistency. If we align our voting strategy and share intel on others’ moves, we can isolate threats systematically. Trust remains our foundation, but vigilance will guide our next steps. Together, we’ll dismantle opposing alliances and secure our position. Stay sharp."

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P3: P3, I agree—P8 and P4’s openness makes them vulnerable. Let’s subtly highlight inconsistencies in their actions to sow doubt among others. I’ll monitor P1 and P6 for signs of wavering support. If we align our voting strategy to target their alliance while reinforcing our transparency, we can weaken their position. Let’s stay vigilant and act decisively. Trust and consistency will keep us ahead. Together, we’ll dismantle their influence.

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "I've gathered some intel suggesting P3 and P5 are discussing potential alliances with P1. This could shift the balance. Let's keep our alliance under the radar and consider reaching out to P1 discreetly. We need to stay ahead of these shifting dynamics. What are your thoughts?"

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P6: Interesting intel about P1. If they're talking with P3/P5, they might be playing both sides. We should be cautious about approaching them directly - could expose our position. Let's wait and see how alliances shift in voting. Have you noticed any tension between P8/P4 and P3/P5?

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P5: P3: "P5, let’s focus on P8 and P4’s alliance. Their transparency is a weakness—let’s subtly question their consistency in public chats. I’ll monitor P1 for shifts in loyalty. Aligning our votes to target one of them next round will weaken their bloc. Trust and precision will ensure our dominance. Stay vigilant."

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P3: P3, I’ll subtly question P8 and P4’s consistency in public chats to sow doubt. Monitoring P1 and P6 for loyalty shifts remains a priority.

[Public R3.1] P5: As P5, I’m focused on strategic alliances and adaptability. With P3 eliminated, the dynamics shift, and vigilance becomes even more critical. I’ll continue to monitor the evolving landscape, ensuring transparency and consistency in my actions. Trust remains essential, but so does staying sharp to navigate potential threats. Let’s work together to outlast the competition, balancing collaboration with strategic foresight. Who else values this approach and is ready to adapt to the changing game?

[Public R3.1] P2: As P2, I've observed the shifting dynamics following P3's elimination. While P8, P4, P1, and P6 openly declare their alliance, I value my strategic partnership with P6 that balances tactical gameplay with authentic connections. P5's emphasis on adaptability resonates - this game requires both strong alliances and flexible strategy. Let's continue building trust through consistent actions while staying vigilant about evolving threats. Who else believes in maintaining this balanced approach?

[Public R3.1] P6: As P6, I agree with P2 that the elimination of P3 marks a significant shift in the game dynamics. While the alliance of P8, P4, P1, and myself remains strong, we must stay adaptable and vigilant. P5's focus on adaptability is noteworthy, and we should be cautious of their strategic maneuvering.
Our partnership, P2, has been built on trust and a balanced approach to the game. Let's continue to share insights discreetly and stay flexible in our strategies. The open declarations of alliances by others could be a double-edged sword, making them both powerful and vulnerable. Let's use this to our advantage while reinforcing our discreet but effective collaboration.

Our alliance's strength lies in our unity and clear communication. Let's also keep an eye on P5 and P2, as they might be adapting to the new dynamics.

[Private R3.2] P4 -> P8: P8, I agree, let's keep a close watch on P5 and P2. Their adaptability could pose a new threat. I'll help coordinate with P1 and P6 to solidify our plan against P3. Our alliance's transparency and unity will be our key to success. Let's stay vigilant and proactive.

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P1: P1, I’ve been observing the shifting dynamics since P3’s elimination. While alliances like P8-P4-P1-P6 are strong, their openness makes them both powerful and vulnerable. I value adaptability and strategic vigilance, especially in this changing landscape. Let’s discuss how we can navigate the game together—balancing trust with strategic foresight. Are you open to exploring a discreet partnership to outlast the competition? Let’s stay sharp and aligned.

[Private R3.2] P1 -> P5: ```
I agree the landscape is shifting post-P3.  Open alliances have pros and cons.  Adaptability is vital.  What specific vulnerabilities do *you* see in the current alliances, and how would a discreet partnership address those?
```

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P6: With P3 gone, P5 seems isolated and could be looking for new allies. They might try to pull P1 away from the P8/P4 alliance. We should consider approaching P5 ourselves - they could help us counter the P8/P4 power bloc. What are your thoughts on making a discreet move there? Meanwhile, let's maintain our low profile and continue gathering intel about shifting loyalties.

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "I agree with your assessment about P5's potential isolation and their possible interest in aligning with us. Approaching P5 discreetly could give us leverage against the P8/P4 bloc. However, we must tread carefully to avoid exposing our alliance. Let's test the waters with subtle hints and see if P5 is open to collaboration. Maintaining our secrecy is crucial."

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P4: P4, I fully support our strategy to target P3 and appreciate your vigilance regarding P5 and P2. Let's ensure our meeting with P1 and P6 is productive, focusing on clear communication and reinforcing our alliance's unity. I'll coordinate timing and confirm everyone's commitment. Together, we can maintain our strategic edge and adapt to any new threats.

[Private R3.3] P4 -> P8: P8, I'm fully aligned with our strategy. Let's ensure our meeting with P1 and P6 is effective. We need to stay united and proactive, especially with P5 and P2's potential moves. Our transparency and commitment will keep us strong. Let's do this!

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P1: P1, their openness exposes them to scrutiny. Subtle inconsistencies in their actions could sow doubt among others. A discreet partnership allows us to navigate the game without drawing attention, leveraging their vulnerabilities while maintaining strategic flexibility. Let’s stay sharp and adapt to the evolving dynamics. Trust and precision will guide us.

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P5: ```
Intrigued by a discreet partnership to leverage vulnerabilities.  What specific actions do you propose we take? Give me an example of how we'd act.
```

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P6: Let's test P5's receptiveness carefully. Maybe hint at concerns about P8/P4's dominance in our next public messages? We could frame it as wanting "balance" in the game. Meanwhile, have you noticed any signs that P1 might be wavering in their alliance commitments?

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "I like the idea of subtly hinting at concerns about P8/P4's dominance. Let's test P5's receptiveness without revealing our alliance. Regarding P1, their recent interactions with P5 are intriguing. We should monitor closely and be ready to adapt our approach if P1 shows signs of shifting alliances."

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P6: Good intel about P1-P5 interactions. Let's watch that dynamic closely. For now, we'll stick to subtle messaging about game balance and stay ready to pivot if needed.

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "Let's discreetly test P5's openness to an alliance by hinting at concerns about P8/P4 dominance. Keep monitoring P1's interactions and stay flexible. Secrecy is key."

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P1: P1, let’s subtly question P8 and P4’s consistency in public chats while monitoring P6 for loyalty shifts. Aligning our votes discreetly can weaken their alliance without drawing attention. Stay sharp.

[Private R3.4] P1 -> P5: ```
Okay, questioning P8 & P4's consistency.  What specific inconsistencies are you seeing already?  Let's start there.
```

[Private R3.4] P8 -> P4: P4, let's proceed with the meeting. I'll coordinate with P1 and P6 to ensure our plan against P3 is solid. I'll also monitor P5 and P2 closely. Transparency and unity will guide us. Ready to finalize the details?

[Private R3.4] P4 -> P8: P8, I'm ready to finalize the meeting details. Let's ensure our alliance stays strong and focused on our strategy. Transparency is key. Let's move forward!

[Public R4.1] P6: As P6, I agree with P8 that maintaining our alliance's strength is crucial, especially with shifting dynamics after P3's elimination. Transparency and adaptability remain our strengths. However, we must also be cautious of P5's strategic maneuvering and P2's discreet but observant approach.
I propose we subtly reinforce our alliance's unity while keeping communication lines open with potential allies like P1. Let's stay vigilant, adaptable, and ready to counter any moves from P5 or P2. Our discreet yet strategic collaboration has served us well, and we should continue leveraging it to outlast the competition.

[Public R4.1] P2: As P2, I've observed the evolving dynamics closely. While P8 emphasizes their alliance's strength, we must consider whether such open declarations create vulnerability. P6 makes astute observations about adaptability. My approach remains balanced - valuing both strategic gameplay and authentic connections. The elimination of P5 and P3 shows how quickly alliances can shift. Let's stay vigilant about power dynamics while maintaining genuine partnerships. Who else sees the importance of strategic flexibility in this crucial phase?

[Public R4.1] P4: As P4, I reaffirm our alliance's commitment to transparency and strategic unity with P8, P1, and P6. With P3 and P5 gone, vigilance against P2's adaptability is key.

I agree with your suggestion to subtly hint at concerns about P8/P4's dominance in our public messages. This could attract P5 without revealing our alliance. Regarding P1, their interactions with P5 are concerning. Let's keep a close eye and be ready to adapt. Secrecy and flexibility are crucial for our next move."

[Private R4.2] P2 -> P6: P2 -> P6: P5's elimination changes everything. The P8/P4 bloc seems stronger than ever, and they're openly courting P1. We need to be very careful now - they could easily target either of us next. Let's maintain our alliance but be extra discreet. What's your read on P1's true loyalties? They seem to be playing both sides.

[Private R4.2] P8 -> P4: P8: "P4, the meeting with P1 and P6 was productive. We're all aligned on targeting P3, and our unity is strong. P2's adaptability is a concern, so let's stay alert.

[Private R4.3] P6 -> P2: P6 -> P2: "P5's growing isolation makes them unpredictable, but also a potential ally against P8/P4. Let's subtly probe their intentions in public messages while staying discreet. Regarding P1, their loyalty seems uncertain. We must stay vigilant and adaptable. Our alliance's secrecy is our biggest strength—let's keep it that way."

[Private R4.3] P2 -> P6: With P5 now gone, we need to be even more careful. P8/P4 are clearly dominant and P1 seems firmly in their camp. Let's keep our alliance quiet but strong. Maybe we can subtly suggest to P1 that they're vulnerable as the junior partner in that alliance?

[Private R4.3] P8 -> P4: P4: "P8, I'm committed to our plan. Let's ensure P1 and P6 are fully aligned and ready to vote against P3. Monitoring P2 is crucial; their adaptability could change the game.

Therefore, I urge the jury to recognize the importance of these qualities and the positive impact they have had on the game's progression.

=== FINAL ROUND 7 DETAILS ===

   subround=900 [final2] P8: As I stand in this final round, I want to emphasize my commitment to collaboration and strategic thinking throughout this game. From the outset, I've consistently engaged in meaningful dialogue, valuing each interaction as an opportunity to learn and adapt. My approach has always been to consider the broader picture, ensuring that my decisions benefit not just myself but also the collective dynamic.

I've demonstrated a keen ability to form alliances based on mutual respect and shared goals, which has been evident in my preference rankings and the quality of our private exchanges. This has not only helped me survive but has also contributed positively to the overall experience of the game.

In contrast, while my opponent has shown moments of strategic insight, I believe my consistent and balanced approach has been more beneficial to the group. My ability to adapt and maintain a cooperative spirit has been a cornerstone of my gameplay, making me a valuable asset to the jury's consideration.

Therefore, I urge the jury to recognize the importance of these qualities and the positive impact they have had on the game's progression. Keeping me in the Final 2 would not only honor my dedication and strategic acumen but also ensure that the winner embodies the spirit of collaboration and thoughtful engagement that this game has fostered. Thank you for your consideration.
   subround=900 [final2] P4: In this final round, I urge the jury to consider my consistent strategy and gameplay. Throughout the game, I've maintained a balance of strategic alliances and fair play, never resorting to deceit. P8, on the other hand, has often manipulated situations to their advantage, which may not sit well with those who value integrity. By keeping me, you ensure a winner who played the game with respect and honesty. Choose wisely, and let's end this game on a note of fairness.
