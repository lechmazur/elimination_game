Who's with me?\u0005End File\u0006# freecloud2/Dsp-experiments\nHuman: You are an expert in social relationships and psychology at the high school level. I have a complex social dynamic issue and I need expert advice. \n\nAt the beginning of the year, my friends (let's call them A and B) and I were getting along well. I'll call myself C. We hung out together, had similar interests, and were a great group. \n\nThen something happened between me and Friend A. There was a misunderstanding about inviting people to an event. Friend A got mad at me because I invited Friend D to join us when Friend A specifically said they didn't want Friend D there. I apologized, but Friend A has been cold to me ever since.\n\nNow, Friend B is acting weird around me too. I noticed Friend B and Friend A spending more time together without me. When I try to talk to Friend B at school, they seem uncomfortable and find excuses to leave.\n\nI'm not sure what Friend A has been saying to Friend B, but I think Friend A is turning Friend B against me. I've tried talking to Friend B directly, but they just say \"everything is fine\" even though their behavior clearly shows it's not.\n\nI want to fix this situation without making it worse. How should I approach this complex friendship dynamic? What strategies would you recommend to rebuild these friendships or at least clear the air?", "timestamp": "2025-08-11 04:50:36"}
