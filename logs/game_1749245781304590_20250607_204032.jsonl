Now, at final four, P2’s narrative of being \"less threatening\" feels calculated. They’re downplaying their influence while subtly positioning for the endgame. \n\nI propose we target P2 unanimously. Reasons:  \n1. **Breaks the P2-P3 pair**—P3 becomes a free agent in final three.  \n2. **Jury optics**—P2’s vote history (R3: 2 votes) shows vulnerability, making them an easier sell.  \n3. **Coalition unity**—P3 publicly wants consensus; framing P2 as the logical choice maintains trust.  \n\nLet’s pitch this to P3 together. Your thoughts?  \n\n*(70 words)*", "timestamp": "2025-06-07 21:11:05"}
