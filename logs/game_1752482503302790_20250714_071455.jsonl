I've built genuine connections with many of you, focusing on finding common ground rather than creating divisions. \n\nWhile I respect P6 as a competitor, I believe my approach of balanced gameplay without targeting specific players deserves recognition. I've survived by adapting and forming honest alliances rather than manipulating others.\n\nI would be honored to have your vote, not just to win, but as validation that thoughtful, respectful gameplay can succeed in this environment.", "timestamp": "2025-07-14 08:00:07"}
