This will help me identify who might be a reliable partner or a potential threat.\n\n2. **Observation:** By carefully listening to others, I can pick up on subtle cues and dynamics that may not be immediately obvious. This will aid in making informed decisions during the preference ranking and voting phases.\n\n3. **Diplomacy:** I will maintain a diplomatic tone in my interactions, avoiding any language that could be perceived as aggressive or confrontational. This will help me build rapport and reduce the likelihood of being targeted for elimination.\n\n4. **Adaptability:** As the game progresses, I will remain flexible, ready to adjust my strategy based on new information and changing dynamics.\n\nIn this first public subround, I will introduce myself as a collaborative player who values mutual understanding and strategic alliances.
