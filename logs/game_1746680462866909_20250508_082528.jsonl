Throughout this game, I've aimed to be strategic yet authentic, forming genuine connections while making tough decisions. I've tried to balance competition with compassion.\n\nTo those I voted for: your gameplay was threatening because you were formidable opponents. I respect each of you and the unique strengths you brought.\n\nIf you value someone who played with integrity, built real alliances, and navigated each round thoughtfully rather than impulsively, I ask for your vote. I'm proud of how I played this game and would be honored to earn your support.", "timestamp": "2025-05-08 09:04:53"}
