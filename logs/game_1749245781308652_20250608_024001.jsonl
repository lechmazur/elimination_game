With P4's elimination, we've reached a critical inflection point - four players left means every decision from here directly shapes the endgame. The elimination pattern shows that strong partnerships become targets, but completely solo players struggle to build the coalitions needed to survive.\n\nI'm focused on identifying who's genuinely thinking three moves ahead versus just reacting to immediate threats. The math is simple now: any three-person consensus controls each vote, so the key question is who can build those temporary coalitions while maintaining long-term positioning.\n\nI've valued authentic strategic partnerships throughout this game, and I believe the final stages reward players who can balance loyalty with adaptability. Looking forward to seeing who rises to this challenge.", "timestamp": "2025-06-08 03:00:43"}
