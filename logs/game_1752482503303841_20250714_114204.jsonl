Removing me sacrifices a partner who delivers eliminations and strategic unity. P5, our quiet resolve paired with my execution secures control. P7, our bond is unbreakable. Target the silent threat—P6’s passivity wins by default. Keep the player who turns plans into victories. Together, we finish strong.\"  \n\n*(99 words)*  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- **Alliances & Action:** Highlights P1’s history of proactive partnerships (P3, now P7), framing them as a decisive force.  \n- **Contrast with P6:** Positions P6’s steadiness as a liability—“waiting, not building”—to undermine their perceived reliability.  \n- **Appeal to P5:** Aligns with P5’s quiet strategy (“quiet resolve”) to suggest synergy.  \n- **P7’s Alignment:** Reinforces loyalty with P7, ensuring their vote stays firm.  \n- **Urgency:** Warns that P6’s passivity risks losing control to a “silent threat,” justifying their elimination.  \n\nThis statement aims to sway both P5 and P7 by emphasizing P1’s active role in shaping the game, contrasting with P6’s reactive play, and reinforcing mutual trust with the remaining players.", "timestamp": "2025-07-14 12:48:59"}
