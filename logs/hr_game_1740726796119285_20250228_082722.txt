P4 and P5 are a bit more focused on adaptability, which could be strategic but might also signal unpredictability. I’m keeping an eye on P8; their message felt a bit generic. What’s your take?

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P2: Okay, I agree with your read on P1, P3, and P6. P4 and P5's adaptability could be useful, but I share your caution. I also thought P8's message was generic. Let's keep an eye on them. Perhaps we should solidify an alliance with one of P1, P3, or P6?

Feel free to share any specific ideas or concerns you have about this potential alliance.

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P7: "Glad we’re on the same page, P7. P1 is definitely our top priority for an alliance. If that doesn’t work, P3 is a strong backup.

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P1: P6: "I agree, P1. Let's propose the alliance to P4 and P5 in the next round. For the vote, we should consider targeting P2 or P7, as their alliance seems strong and could pose a threat. Let's stay flexible and adapt our strategy as needed."

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P4: P3: "Thanks for your positive response, P4. I think our next step should be to discreetly propose this alliance to P5 and P6, ensuring we're all on the same page. Let's prioritize eliminating threats like P7 or P2 to solidify our position. Thoughts on how to approach this?"

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P3: P4: "I agree with your plan, P3. Let's approach P5 and P6 subtly, emphasizing mutual benefits and shared goals. We should ensure they understand the strategic advantage of joining us. As for P7 and P2, let's gather more intel before making any moves. Maintaining discretion is key."

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P6: P1 -> P6: "Let's solidify our alliance with P4 and P5 next round. For the vote, targeting P7 seems strategic to weaken their alliance. Thoughts?"

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P2: Okay, P2. Let's lock in our strategy. P1 is the priority, P3 second. Keep watch on P4/P5. High rankings for P1 from both of us.
