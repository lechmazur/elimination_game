Throughout this process, I've consistently aimed to foster constructive dialogue and build alliances based on mutual respect and shared goals. My approach has been one of collaboration, seeking to understand and integrate diverse perspectives, which has been instrumental in navigating the complexities of this game.\n\nIn contrast, while my fellow competitor has demonstrated strategic acumen, there have been moments where their tactics seemed to prioritize short-term gains over long-term collaboration. This approach, though effective at times, may not align with the jury's likely preference for a participant who values collective progress and integrity.\n\nTherefore, I urge the jury to consider the broader impact of our actions and the values we embody.
