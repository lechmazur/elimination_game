I need to make a public statement that's up to ~80 words. Let me look at the current situation and my history.\n\nFirst, the active seats are P5, P1 (me), P4, P7, P8. Eliminated are P3, P6, P2. So we're down to five players. My alliance with P4 has been strong for three rounds, and we've coordinated votes together. In Round 3, we targeted P5, but it ended in a tie-break, and P2 was eliminated instead. Now, with P2 gone, the pairs are shifting.\n\nLooking at recent public statements:\n- P5 is still playing pragmatic, looking for partners and avoiding drama.\n- P7 emphasizes trust and strategic alliances.\n- P8 talks about trust, mentions their past alliance with P2 (who's now eliminated), and wants stability.\n- P4 reinforces our alliance and is open to private talks.\n\nMy strategy has been to maintain my alliance with P4, as it's proven reliable. We need to be careful now because with fewer players, other alliances might target us. P8 is without a partner since P2 was eliminated, so they might be vulnerable or looking to align with others. P5 and P7 seem to be a pair, but in Round 3, they might have been targeted by us.\n\nFor my public statement, I should:\n1. Reaffirm my alliance with P4 to show strength and unity.\n2. Emphasize trust and logical play, as that's been consistent.\n3. Be open to private conversations to explore new dynamics, especially with P8 now alone.\n4. Avoid targeting anyone publicly to prevent drawing unnecessary attention.\n\nWord count is crucial—keep it around 80 words. Make it concise and strategic.\n\nDrafting:\n\"P1 here. My alliance with P4 remains unwavering—built on trust and coordinated strategy. With P2 gone, dynamics shift, and I value clear, logical play. Private conversations will be key to navigating this round wisely. I'm open to discussions with those prioritizing integrity and mutual survival. Let's stay focused and make smart moves together.\"\n\nThat's about 60 words. It reinforces my bond with P4, acknowledges the change, invites private talks, and promotes stability. Good.P1 here. My alliance with P4 remains rock-solid—built on trust and strategic coordination. With P2 eliminated, the field narrows, and logical, adaptable play is crucial. Private conversations will guide our next steps; I’m open to talks with those valuing integrity and mutual survival. Let’s prioritize clear communication and avoid chaos. Solidarity and smart moves will carry us forward.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 18:54:48"}
