This will inform my preference rankings and voting decisions.\n\n4. **Subtle Influence**: By subtly hinting at my strategic approach, I can influence others to view me as a key player, which might deter them from voting me out early.\n\nHere's my public statement:\n\n---\n\n\"Hello, everyone. As P3, I'm committed to fostering constructive dialogue and strategic alliances. I believe that by working together, we can navigate this game effectively.
