I've built genuine connections with many of you, sharing honest thoughts while respecting everyone's position. \n\nI never targeted anyone out of spite - only making strategic choices when necessary. I've survived by adapting and building alliances rather than manipulating.\n\nP8 has played well, but I believe my balanced approach of strategy and authenticity deserves your vote. I've tried to earn my place here through respect and thoughtful gameplay rather than deception.\n\nThank you for considering me worthy of the win.", "timestamp": "2025-02-26 09:14:01"}
