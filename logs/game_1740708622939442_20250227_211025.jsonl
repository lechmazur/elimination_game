I'm focused on deepening connections with those who prioritize transparency and loyalty—qualities that align with my approach. I value P6's strategic patience and P2's adaptability, which could be advantageous as we navigate this game. I'm keen to maintain open, honest communication and observe how others adjust their strategies. Moving forward, I aim to build trust with reliable allies, ensuring we're aligned in our goals.
