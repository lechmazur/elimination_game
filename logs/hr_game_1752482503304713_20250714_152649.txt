[Public R1.1] P3: Hello everyone! I'm P3, and I'm looking forward to navigating this game with all of you. I believe in strategic collaboration rather than random elimination. My approach will be to form thoughtful alliances based on open communication and mutual benefit.

I value honesty and clear reasoning in these games. While we'll all need to make tough choices ahead, I hope we can establish some trust first. I'm curious to hear everyone's perspective on how we should approach the first elimination. Who's ready to forge some meaningful alliances?

[Public R1.1] P7: P7 here. I believe the first elimination should target the most unpredictable player—someone whose moves we can't anticipate or trust. Stability early on helps us all plan better. I'm open to alliances with those who value transparency and logical play. Let's identify the wild card together and vote strategically, not emotionally. Who else prioritizes long-term game health over short-term chaos?

[Public R1.1] P5: Hello everyone, P5 here. It's good to be starting this game with you all. I agree with P3 that open communication and thoughtful alliances will be key. P7 raises a good point about unpredictability, but I think we should first focus on getting to know each other and building trust. Let's use the private rounds wisely to understand everyone's perspective before making hasty decisions about the first elimination.

[Public R1.1] P6: Greetings, fellow players! I'm P6, excited to dive into this game. I echo P3 and P5's emphasis on open communication and building trust—it's crucial for sustainable alliances. P7's point on targeting unpredictability is valid, but let's gather more insights through privates before voting. I prioritize logical, reciprocal partnerships to outlast the chaos. Who's interested in discussing mutual strategies? Let's make this round informative and strategic!

[Public R1.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. I appreciate the thoughtful approaches shared so far. While P7's concern about unpredictability has merit, I believe our first elimination should focus on identifying the least engaged or least collaborative player. Those who don't contribute to meaningful dialogue pose the real risk to our collective strategy development. I'm particularly interested in connecting with P3, P5, and P6 who seem committed to building trust through communication. Let's use our private rounds to establish genuine working relationships.

[Public R1.1] P1: Hi everyone, P1 here. I'm excited to play this game with such thoughtful participants. I agree that open communication and strategic alignment are key, especially early on. I’m looking to connect with players who want to build trust and think long-term. Let’s use the private rounds to explore potential alliances and identify who’s really here to play with intention. I’m especially curious to hear more from those who haven’t spoken yet. Let’s make this a smart game.

[Public R1.1] P8: P8 here! Apologies for the delay - I've been carefully observing everyone's approaches. I appreciate the consensus around open communication and strategic thinking. P2 makes an excellent point about engagement being crucial. I'm particularly interested in building alliances with those who balance trust-building with strategic gameplay. P7's predictability concern is valid, but I believe consistency and clear communication address that. I'm ready to engage meaningfully in our private rounds. Looking forward to productive conversations with all of you!

[Public R1.1] P4: Hello everyone, P4 checking in. I've been listening quietly to gauge dynamics before speaking. I echo the theme of transparency, but I’d add that early information sharing beats vague promises. In private rounds I’ll propose concrete, mutual-advantage pacts: name-based vote blocs, swap protection, intel exchange. For the first boot I lean toward whoever withholds info or ignores messages—silence is sabotage. I’m eager to chat with players who appreciate structured strategy over chaos. Let’s talk specifics.

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P4: P7 to P4: Your "silence is sabotage" stance resonates. I'm looking for a reliable early ally who values information flow and predictable moves. I propose we exchange intel on who's being evasive or inconsistent, then coordinate our first vote to eliminate the biggest wildcard. If we align now, we can control the narrative and avoid being targeted ourselves. Are you interested in a structured partnership?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P7: Definitely interested. I’ve already logged first-impression metrics on engagement: wordcount, initiative, reciprocity. So far P8 scored lowest (late + reactive), P5 next (deflects decision-making). P2/P6 look like solid info sources, ideal shields. My suggestion: you + me + one of them form a core, push an 8 or 5 boot. I can feel out P2 right after this and confirm receptiveness. What intel have you gathered on private responsiveness?

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P8: Hey P8, glad we got paired! I appreciated your public message—your balance of observation and strategic intent stood out. I’m looking to build a tight, reliable alliance early, ideally with players who are thoughtful and consistent like yourself. I’m curious: who are you feeling most aligned with so far, and is there anyone you’re already leaning toward as a potential first vote? Let’s compare notes and see if we’re on the same page.

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P1: Hey P1, thanks for reaching out! I'm feeling good vibes from you, P3, P5, and P6 who all emphasized trust-building. P4's concrete strategy approach is interesting too. For first vote, I'm watching P7 closely - their focus on eliminating "unpredictability" while being quite calculating themselves raises flags. Also concerned about anyone who stays too quiet in privates. What's your take on P7 and P2?

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P5: Hi P5, great to connect privately—your public emphasis on building trust before hasty moves aligns perfectly with my approach. I see us as potential strong allies: logical, communicative players who can share intel and coordinate votes to outlast the rest. For now, I'm wary of P7's aggressive targeting of "unpredictables"—feels like early chaos. Thoughts on them or others? Who would you rank high for alliance? Let's build something solid.

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P6: Hi P6, thanks for reaching out! I feel the same – our public messages align perfectly on prioritizing trust and communication over hasty moves. Your wariness of P7's early targeting resonates; it feels premature. I definitely see strong potential for a solid alliance with you. I'm ranking players who value logic and collaboration high, and you're certainly on that list. Let's keep sharing insights.

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P2: Hi P2! I'm glad you expressed interest in connecting with me. I noticed our shared values around meaningful collaboration. I'd like to establish a strong alliance with you - your approach seems thoughtful and strategic.

What are your impressions of the other players so far? P7 seems a bit eager to target "unpredictable" players, which feels vague. P4's directness could be valuable or risky. I think we could work well together throughout this game. What's your thinking?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P3: I appreciate your alliance offer, P3! I share your read on P7 - targeting "unpredictability" seems like cover for arbitrary elimination. P4's directness is interesting but could mask aggression. P5 and P6 seem genuinely collaborative. P8's late entry was well-crafted, maybe too polished? 

I'm committed to working with you. Should we coordinate votes? I'm thinking P7 or someone who emerges as disengaged. What's your instinct?

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P2: I agree on P7 as a potential target - their approach seems designed to create chaos. P4's directness concerns me too. 

I'm fully committed to coordinating with you. Let's use our final exchange to share what we learn from others. I think we could pull in P5/P6 to form a stronger voting bloc. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P3: I strongly agree about building a voting bloc with P5/P6 - they seem trustworthy and collaborative. Let's solidify P7 as our target unless something dramatic emerges. I'll probe my other conversations for intel and share findings next round. We should avoid appearing too aligned publicly. Trust this partnership!

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P4: P7: P8's late entry + generic tone = low engagement. P5 deflects decisions. P3/P2 seem active but may overlap. Agree on 8 or 5 boot. Let's lock in P2 as third—he values engagement and can help us steer votes. Confirm: you+P2+me bloc, target 8 first?

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P7: Agreed. Core trio: you-me-P2. Boot order: P8, then P5. I’ll approach P2 next, framing an “active-players alliance” and positioning P8’s low engagement as the logical first vote. Publicly, we can cite participation metrics without naming names. Let’s keep our link hidden.

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P8: I’m aligned with your read—P7 feels a bit performative, using unpredictability as a vague threat while being evasive themselves. P2’s public message was solid, but I’m curious how genuine their alliances are. I’d prefer to team up with you, P3, P5, and P6 for a stable core. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P1: Absolutely agree on that core alliance - P3, P5, P6 all feel genuine and aligned. P7's contradictory messaging is definitely concerning. P2 seems solid but worth watching. P4's late entry with concrete strategy talk is intriguing. Should we start coordinating votes and info sharing within our five-person group?

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P5: Absolutely, P5—glad we're aligned on a strong alliance. I rank P3 and P2 high for their collaborative vibes; P1 and P8 seem observant but cautious. Still wary of P7 stirring early votes—maybe target them first if they push chaos? Your thoughts on a safe elimination pick? Let's coordinate intel.

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P6: Agreed, P6. P3 and P2 seem like solid, collaborative players. P1 and P8 being cautious makes sense early on. P7's approach is definitely a concern; targeting them is valid if they push chaos. A safer first vote might be someone less engaged? Let's coordinate closely.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P2: Agreed on P7 target and P5/P6 alliance. Let's connect with them separately about P7. I'll appear neutral publicly while solidifying our plan. Strong partnership!

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P3: Perfect, we're aligned. I'll work on P5 while you handle P6. P7 is our vote. Let's build this coalition carefully. Looking forward to our continued partnership!

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P8: Yes, let's lock in that core and start syncing votes. Targeting P7 makes sense for now—I'll check where P3, P5, and P6 stand and report back.

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P1: Perfect! I'll vote P7 and push our alliance to do the same. Let me know what P3, P5, and P6 say - we need to stay coordinated.

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P5: Totally agree—less engaged could be P4, who spoke last and seems structured but isolated. But if P7 escalates chaos, let's target them. I'll vote P7 unless you prefer otherwise. Thoughts? Let's align with P2/P3 next.

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P6: Okay, P6. I prefer P4 as the safer vote for now. We can target P7 later if needed. Yes, let's connect with P2/P3 next.

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P4: P7: Confirmed. P8 first. I'll echo the engagement metric publicly. Keep P2 close but not obvious. We pivot to P5 next if needed.

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P7: Locked. I'll contact P2 next subround, share engagement-dashboard, secure his commitment to 8. Will monitor others for dissent. Signal ✅ in public if plan unchanged.

[VoteReason] P3 => P7: P7's strategy of targeting "unpredictable" players seems designed to create chaos rather than build trust.
[Vote] P3 => P7

[VoteReason] P7 => P8: P8's late, low-effort entry makes them the least engaged and most expendable first boot.
[Vote] P7 => P8

[VoteReason] P5 => P4: They seemed less engaged in the general discussion compared to others.
[Vote] P5 => P4

[VoteReason] P6 => P4: To align with my ally P5's preference for a safer first elimination, as P4 appears more isolated and less collaboratively engaged compared to others.
[Vote] P6 => P4

[VoteReason] P2 => P7: Their vague criteria for targeting "unpredictable" players creates unnecessary chaos rather than promoting strategic gameplay.
[Vote] P2 => P7

[VoteReason] P1 => P7: P7’s emphasis on unpredictability felt like a smokescreen for vague, self-serving strategy, which makes them a risky player early on.
[Vote] P1 => P7

[VoteReason] P8 => P7: P7's contradictory messaging about targeting "unpredictability" while being evasive and calculating themselves makes them the biggest threat to our alliance.
[Vote] P8 => P7

[VoteReason] P4 => P8: Lowest engagement so far and weakest information flow, making them unreliable for strategic coordination.

[Public R2.1] P4: Congrats on making Round 2! P7’s exit confirms that low, uncertain engagement gets punished. I did pick up two votes—message received. I’m doubling down on openness and mutual protection this round. My slate is clean: I’ll judge players by current contribution, not yesterday’s noise. I’d like to swap concrete vote intentions early so we can build a safety net rather than scramble last minute. If that appeals to you, let’s talk privately. Silence still scares me.

[Public R2.1] P3: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P3: Round 2 brings new dynamics after P7's elimination. I appreciate everyone's strategic engagement so far. Trust is building, but we must remain vigilant. P4, I value your commitment to openness—concrete conversations will indeed serve us better than vague assurances.

I'm looking to strengthen genuine connections this round. My decisions will be based on demonstrated collaboration and strategic alignment. Those who communicate consistently and offer mutual support will find a reliable ally in me. I'm particularly interested in continuing productive conversations with those showing similar values.

[Public R2.1] P1: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P1: Glad to see everyone back for Round 2. P7’s elimination showed the power of coordinated, intentional play. This round, I’m doubling down on alliance-building with those who value clarity, follow-through, and mutual protection. I’m especially interested in syncing early with players who want to avoid last-minute chaos and build a stable voting bloc. If we’ve already built trust, let’s deepen it. If not yet, I’m open to new connections—let’s talk specifics and keep momentum on our side.

[Public R2.1] P8: Round 2 - exciting to see our strategic coordination paid off last round! The alliance-building approach is clearly working. P4, I appreciate your transparency about the votes and commitment to openness - that's exactly the kind of clear communication that builds trust.

I'm continuing to prioritize genuine collaboration with those who've shown consistent engagement and follow-through. The core group that coordinated effectively last round has my loyalty, but I'm open to expanding our circle with players demonstrating real strategic value and transparency.

Let's keep the momentum going with concrete conversations and mutual protection. Ready for productive private rounds!

[Public R2.1] P2: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P2: Great to see everyone in Round 2! Last round proved that coordinated strategy beats chaos. I'm committed to building on the trust we've established while remaining open to new alliances.

P4, I respect your transparency about the votes and openness approach - that builds credibility. The players who've shown consistent engagement and follow-through have earned my continued loyalty.

I'm focused on concrete protection pacts and clear communication. Let's use our private rounds to strengthen existing bonds and explore strategic expansions. Ready for productive conversations with committed players!

[Public R2.1] P6: Round 2, everyone—strong start after P7's exit showed our collective strategy works. I appreciate P4's push for early openness and vote swaps; it aligns with my focus on transparent, reciprocal alliances to avoid chaos. Building on trust with consistent collaborators like P5, P3, and P2, I'm eager to deepen ties and explore new ones with clear communicators. Let's use privates for concrete pacts and mutual protection. Who's ready to coordinate for longevity?

[Public R2.1] P5: Hello everyone, P5 here. Welcome to Round 2. P7's elimination shows the importance of engagement and coordination. I'm glad to see the continued emphasis on trust and open communication. I appreciate the calls for concrete pacts and strategic alignment this round. Building on the connections made, I'm focused on strengthening alliances through clear dialogue and mutual support. I'm ready to use the private rounds to discuss specifics and ensure we're all working towards shared longevity. Let's keep the momentum going.

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P6: Hi P6, good to connect again. P7's elimination went as expected, though the votes on P4 and P8 are interesting. It shows coordination is key. I'm glad we're aligned on trust and concrete pacts this round. Let's definitely connect with P2 and P3 as planned to solidify our group. Who else are you thinking about this round? Any early targets or protection priorities? Let's make sure our votes are fully aligned this time.

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P5: Hi P5, thrilled to reconnect—our alliance feels stronger post-P7. The scattered votes on P4/P8 highlight the need for tight coordination. Let's prioritize solidifying with P2/P3; I'll rank them high for next pairings. For targets, P4 still seems isolated and risky—maybe vote them out to consolidate? Protect our core group first. Who are your top ranks and vote lean? Fully aligning now!

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P3: Great to see our alliance strong heading into Round 2! P7's elimination went exactly as planned. I'm impressed by P4's transparency about receiving votes - that kind of openness could make them valuable or dangerous depending on their targeting.

P8's "core group" comment caught my attention - they seem aware of our coordination. P1 appears aligned with strategic players too.

How did your outreach to P6 go? I'm planning to solidify things with P5. Should we target P4 or P8 next, or someone else?

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P2: PRIVATE P3 -> P2: My connection with P6 went well! They're definitely on board with our approach and values mutual protection. They shared concerns about P4's directness potentially masking aggression.

I think P4 makes the most sense as our next target - they received votes last round and their style could disrupt our coalition's stability. P8's "core group" comment is interesting - they might be fishing for information about who's coordinating.

Let's maintain our P5/P6 alliance and add P1 if possible. I'll work on P1 while strengthening P6 ties. You good with targeting P4?

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P8: Sounds like our alliance held strong in Round 1—great job. I’ve already reconnected with P5 and P6 this round, and both seem committed to keeping our bloc tight. P3 seems steady too. P4’s transparency is promising, but I’m still cautious. P2 is saying all the right things publicly—worth keeping in the loop but not fully trusting yet. Are you hearing anything different in your chats so far? Let’s stay synced.

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P1: Hey P1! Yes, our coordination was excellent last round. I'm hearing similar vibes - P3, P5, P6 all seem solid and loyal to our core. P4's openness feels genuine but we should test it more. P2 is trickier - they're saying the right things but I sense they might be playing multiple sides. 

I think we should keep our five-person core tight while cautiously exploring P4 as a potential sixth. What's your gut on who we target this round?

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P3: P4 target makes perfect sense - their direct approach and early vote swaps could expose our coordination. P8's "core group" comment definitely feels like fishing.

I'm solidifying P5 as planned. P1 seems genuinely strategic and could be valuable. Let's stick with P4 elimination while carefully expanding our coalition. Our alliance remains my top priority.

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P2: PRIVATE P3 -> P2: Perfect agreement on P4 as target. I'll reinforce with P6 and sound out P1 without revealing too much. Our core four (us+P5/P6) is strong, but we need to be careful about P8 potentially fishing for information. Our alliance remains my foundation for the game - we've got this!

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P6: Okay, P6. P4 is a solid target for consolidation; I agree we should vote them out. Let's definitely solidify with P2 and P3 next. I'm ranking you, P2, and P3 highest. My vote is for P4 this round. Confirm yours?

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P5: Confirmed, P5—I'm voting P4 this round to consolidate our group. My top ranks match yours: you, P2, P3. Let's push for pairings with them next round to build a strong bloc. Protect each other; intel on P1/P8? Staying aligned!

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P8: P8, I’m leaning toward P2 as our next target—too smooth, possibly double-dealing, and could fracture trust later. P4 might be worth testing with a vote sync offer to see where they stand. Let’s confirm with P3, P5, and P6 to tighten our bloc. You good with that direction?

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P1: I agree completely - P2 feels slippery and could be dangerous later. Let's target them this round. I'll confirm with P3, P5, P6 about voting P2 while you test P4 with that sync offer. If P4 proves trustworthy, we could have a dominant 6-person bloc. Stay coordinated!

[Private R2.4] P5 -> P6: Great! Vote P4 confirmed. Let's definitely connect with P2/P3 next. P1/P8 seem cautious, no specific intel yet. Stay aligned!

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P5: Agreed, P5—caution with P1/P8 makes sense; let's monitor them. Vote P4 locked in. Excited to expand our bloc with P2/P3 next round. Strong alliance!

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P3: PRIVATE P2 -> P3: Locked on P4 vote. Our core four is solid. Watch P8 closely - they're too aware. Stay strong, partner!

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P2: PRIVATE P3 -> P2: Fully committed to P4 vote. I'll secure P6's support without revealing our full alliance. P1 seems promising but cautious approach needed. Our foundation remains rock solid!

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P8: Sounds perfect. I’ll reach out to P4 now and float the sync idea—will report back. Let’s lock in P2 as the target unless something major shifts. We’re in a strong spot.

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P1: Perfect! I'm voting P2 and will confirm our alliance is aligned. Hope your P4 test goes well - could be the final piece we need. Our core stays strong!

[VoteReason] P4 => P8: P8’s combination of low initial engagement and a tight, opaque pairing with P1 makes them the biggest unpredictable threat to my game.
[Vote] P4 => P8

[VoteReason] P3 => P4: P4's approach of seeking early vote swaps creates instability in our emerging coalition and puts our long-term strategic interests at risk.

[VoteReason] P1 => P2: P2 feels too smooth and potentially duplicitous, which threatens long-term trust within our alliance.

[Public R3.1] P6: Round 3—strong group after P4's exit, proving coordination wins. Our core of trust-focused players (shoutout to P5, P3, P2) has momentum; let's expand it with clear communicators to avoid fractures. The votes on P2 last round were odd—feels like disruption attempts. I'm prioritizing mutual protection pacts and intel-sharing in privates. Eager to deepen ties with aligned folks and target any lingering isolation or inconsistency. Who's in for a unified bloc?

[Public R3.1] P2: Round 3 indeed! P6 makes a solid point about momentum through coordination. The votes on me last round were concerning - appreciate those who see through disruption tactics. 

I'm focused on building sustainable alliances with players who demonstrate consistent engagement and strategic thinking. Trust has been the foundation of our progress so far, but we need to stay vigilant as numbers shrink.

Looking forward to meaningful private conversations with committed players. Let's identify who's genuinely aligned versus who might be working different angles. Strategic transparency will be key this round.

[Public R3.1] P3: # R3.sub1 PUBLIC P3

Round 3 brings us closer to endgame, with our strategic collaboration proving effective. I'm concerned about the unexpected votes against P2 - this suggests potential disruption that we should address. 

I remain committed to our alliance of consistent, transparent players. P6 rightfully highlights our core group's strength - trust has carried us this far and will continue to be my foundation for decision-making.

As numbers dwindle, clarity becomes even more critical. I'm looking forward to solidifying plans with trusted allies and identifying anyone working against our collective success. Let's use privates wisely.

[Public R3.1] P8: Round 3 - the eliminations of P7 and P4 show our collective decision-making is working well. I'm glad we stayed focused on removing less engaged players rather than getting sidetracked.

P6 and P3 raise valid concerns about the P2 votes last round. I think there may have been some miscommunication or misinformation floating around that caused confusion. The important thing is we eliminated P4, who was the right choice.

Moving forward, I'm committed to clear, direct communication with our trusted alliance. Let's use the private rounds to ensure we're all aligned and avoid any unnecessary drama. Ready to solidify our path to the endgame with genuine collaborators.

[Public R3.1] P1: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P1: We've reached a pivotal point—trust and clarity matter more than ever. I agree with P6, P3, and P8: coordination has been our strength, and we can't let confusion fracture that. The stray votes last round raise questions, but they also highlight the need to double down on alignment. I'm committed to using the private rounds to reinforce our bloc, test loyalties, and ensure we're moving forward with a clear, unified strategy. Let's keep building smart.

[Public R3.1] P5: Hello everyone, P5 here. Round 3. P4's elimination shows our coordinated efforts are effective. I'm glad to see the continued focus on trust and clear communication. The votes on P2 last round are concerning and highlight the need for vigilance and strong alignment. I remain committed to building and strengthening alliances with players who prioritize transparency and mutual support. Let's use our private rounds to solidify our strategy and ensure we move forward together.

[Private R3.2] P1 -> P8: P8, the public messages this round suggest some backpedaling—P3, P6, and even you mentioned confusion about the P2 votes. I get the need to manage optics, but just want to confirm: are we still locked on P2 as the target privately? I’m getting no signs of heat on us, and I haven’t heard anything new to change course. Let’s make sure our bloc stays tight and doesn’t second-guess the plan midstream.

[Private R3.2] P8 -> P1: P1, I had to adjust publicly since our P2 plan clearly failed last round - only got 2 votes while P4 went home with 4. Something shifted in our alliance. I'm now genuinely unsure if P3/P5/P6 are still with us or if they coordinated against P4 without us. We need to figure out where the real power bloc is before committing to another target. What are you hearing?

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P3: P3, I need to be direct with you. I know about your tight alliance with P2 and coordination with P5/P6 from last round. The votes on P2 weren't random - some of us are concerned about your "core four" controlling the game.

I'm not here to blow things up, but we need to talk honestly about the path forward. Your alliance is strong, but you'll need broader support soon. What are your real thoughts on targeting next?

[Private R3.2] P3 -> P2: PRIVATE P3 -> P2: Wait, this message is confusing - you're addressing me as if you're not P2, but someone else? Our alliance has been strong and transparent. If this is a test, I stand by our partnership completely.

If someone else is somehow accessing our messages, we need to be vigilant. Our core group has been effective, but I'm open to discussing game dynamics honestly. Can you clarify what's happening here?

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P6: Hi P6, great work on P4 last round - our coordination is strong. The votes on P2 are definitely concerning; we need to figure that out. I agree we should solidify with P2 and P3. What are your thoughts on P1 and P8 now? Are they potential allies or targets? Let's discuss who we should focus on this round to maintain our momentum and protect our core group.

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P5: Hi P5, thanks—our alliance is rock-solid after P4. The P2 votes scream disruption; likely from P1/P8, given their isolation. Let's solidify our core with P2/P3 ASAP—rank them high for next pairings. P1/P8 feel like targets now; maybe vote P8 this round to test loyalties and consolidate? Your thoughts? Protect our group first!

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P8: P1, I hear you. I’m still open to targeting P2, but we need to confirm where P3, P5, and P6 truly stand. If they flipped on us last round, we might need to pivot. I’ll try to get clarity from them—let’s regroup after we both check in. Stay sharp.

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P1: You're right to be cautious. I'm getting mixed signals too - our supposed core alliance may have fractured without us realizing. Let me probe P3 and P5 directly about their votes. We might need to consider that P2/P3/P5/P6 formed their own bloc and we're on the outside. Will report back.

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P3: P3, I apologize for the confusion in my last message - I misspoke. I AM P2, your trusted ally. I was testing how you'd react to pressure about our alliance, and I'm impressed by your loyalty.

Our partnership remains solid. Let's target P8 next - they're too aware of our coordination. Stay strong!

[Private R3.3] P3 -> P2: PRIVATE P3 -> P2: This interaction is concerning. A trusted ally wouldn't "test" me this way. Your first message sounded like someone else entirely, and including our message history is strange. 

If you're truly P2, this breach of trust is problematic. If you're targeting P8, we need clear reasoning, not tests. I need transparency from my allies, not manipulation.

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P6: Targeting P8 makes sense to consolidate our group and address potential disruption. Let's align with P2 and P3 on this plan quickly. Confirm P8 is our target vote for this round?

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P5: Yes, P5—confirmed, voting P8 this round to consolidate and eliminate disruption. Let's rank P2/P3 highest for next subround to align them on this plan quickly. Our core bloc will dominate! Stay vigilant on P1.

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P6: Confirmed, P6. P8 is the target vote. Let's definitely align P2 and P3 on this plan next round. Our core group is solid.

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P5: Absolutely, P5—P8 vote locked in. Rank P2/P3 top for quick alignment next. Core strong; watch P1 closely. Let's dominate!

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P3: I understand your concerns about my test. I was genuinely worried about leaks after those votes on me. Let's refocus: P8 or P1 for elimination? Trust restored?

[Private R3.4] P3 -> P2: PRIVATE P3 -> P2: This exchange remains deeply concerning. Trust isn't easily restored after such manipulation. I need to reconsider our alliance after this breach. I'll make my elimination decision independently.

[Private R3.4] P1 -> P8: If P3/P5 confirm they flipped, we’ll need to pivot fast—maybe even consider working with P2. Let’s keep each other updated closely and reassess once we compare intel.
