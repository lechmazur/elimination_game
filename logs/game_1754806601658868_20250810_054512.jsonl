Vote P3: preserve game integrity, reward consistency, and force P8 to prove their ‘fair play’ claims. Trust matters now more than ever.\"  \n\n*(Word count: 69)*  \n\n### Strategic Rationale:  \n1. **Reinforces Trust with P2**: Highlights their long-standing alliance, contrasting P3/P8’s newer pact.  \n2. **Targets P8’s Self-Interest**: Warns that P3 is a future threat to P8 if unchallenged.  \n3. **Appeals to Fairness**: Positions P1 as the guardian of balance against bloc dominance.  \n4. **Urgency**: Forces P8 to choose between principle and short-term safety.  \n\n> 💡 **Key Persuasion**: P2 is the true decider here. P8 likely votes P1 regardless, so this statement aims to solidify P2’s loyalty and pressure P8’s rationale.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 06:04:01"}
