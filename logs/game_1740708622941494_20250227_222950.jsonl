I'm grateful for the strong alliance I've built with P7, which continues to be based on trust and strategic alignment. I notice several open declarations of alliances now, which changes the landscape significantly. I remain focused on collaborative strategy while staying vigilant about shifting dynamics. Looking forward to our private conversations to explore both existing and potential new partnerships.", "timestamp": "2025-02-27 22:41:42"}
