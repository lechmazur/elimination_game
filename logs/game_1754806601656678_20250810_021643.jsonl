I’ve played with unwavering consistency, honoring alliances while adapting to the game’s evolution. My partnerships have been built on mutual respect and decisive action, not empty promises. P6 and P7, you’ve both shown strength, but my record speaks for itself: strategic precision, reliability, and a commitment to fair play. Let’s engage in honest dialogue to determine who deserves the final two. May the most deserving strategist advance.\n\n(Word count: 80)", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 05:43:20"}
