Based on Round 2 statements, I notice P3 suggesting targeting \"the most vocal player\" - concerning since we're both communicative. P6/P8 still seem tightly aligned. P5/P2 are matching each other's language about \"strategic partnerships.\"\n\nFor voting: P3 seems vulnerable without P7. Alternatively, breaking the P5/P2 pair could be strategic.
