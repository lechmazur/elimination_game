I built bridges, not ambushes, and took risks instead of hiding in ties. P5 often played reactively—benefiting from others’ moves more than leading them. If you value transparent strategy and consistent respect, reward it now. Please eliminate P5 and let a proactive, collaborative game win. Thank you for the trust you gave me along the way.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 08:21:00"}
