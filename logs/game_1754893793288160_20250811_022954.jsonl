Throughout our rounds, I've built genuine connections, been transparent in my intentions, and made moves based on mutual benefit rather than pure self-interest.\n\nI respect P4's gameplay, but I believe my balanced approach of loyalty when possible and necessary strategic shifts when required represents the spirit of this game. I've never targeted anyone without reason and have always valued the relationships we've built.\n\nIf you value thoughtful gameplay over opportunism, I ask for your vote today.", "timestamp": "2025-08-11 03:45:52"}
