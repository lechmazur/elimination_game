I’ve fought every round with strategy, heart, and respect for this game. P4’s path? Built on shifting alliances and hollow promises. You saw their pattern—using others, then discarding them. I’ve uplifted, collaborated, and adapted. I’ve earned my seat here, not luck. P4’s victory rewards manipulation; mine honors perseverance. Reflect on who *deserves* to win. Who made this game meaningful? Who grew, sacrificed, and stayed true? I’ve listened, learned, and fought for every moment. Trust your instincts. Let integrity triumph. The title should go to the player who played not just to win, but to *earn* it. Thank you. Vote for me.\"  \n\n*(Word count: ~80)*", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 06:27:43"}
