[Public R1.1] P5: Hello fellow players! As P5, I'm excited to start this game with all of you. In this first public subround, I'd like to set a positive tone and invite open communication. I'm looking forward to learning more about each of your strategies and finding common ground. Let's work together to make this a fun and engaging game for everyone. What are your initial thoughts on how we can collaborate and outlast each other?

[Public R1.1] P3: Hello everyone! As P3, I appreciate the collaborative spirit P5 introduced. My approach will be strategic yet transparent - I believe in building temporary alliances while maintaining flexibility. In this game, adaptability is key. I'm curious about each player's initial strategy and how we might find mutually beneficial interactions. While survival is the ultimate goal, I'm open to constructive dialogue that could help us navigate this complex elimination challenge together.

[Public R1.1] P1: Hello everyone, I'm P1. I appreciate the positive tone set by P5 and the strategic approach from P3. My strategy is to be adaptable and observant. I believe in forming alliances but also in being prepared to change course if necessary. I'm interested in understanding everyone's strategies and finding ways to collaborate while also ensuring my survival. Let's make this a dynamic and engaging game. What are your thoughts on how we can balance cooperation and competition?

[Public R1.1] P2: Hello everyone, P2 here. P5, P3, and P1 have set a thoughtful tone. Adaptability is crucial, and early observation is key – agreed.  I'm keen to understand what *kind* of collaboration players envision. Short-term alliances, or something longer? Let's discuss!

[Public R1.1] P4: R1.sub1 PUBLIC P4: Building on P2's question, I believe alliances must balance mutual benefit with self-interest. Trust is valuable but fragile – I'm interested in how others plan to demonstrate reliability while protecting their position. Let's discuss tangible ways to align short-term cooperation with long-term survival. What specific criteria will you use to evaluate potential partners in these crucial early stages?

[Public R1.1] P7: Greetings, everyone. P7 here. I echo the sentiments of adaptability and strategic alliance-building. I'm particularly interested in P4's point about demonstrating reliability. Actions speak louder than words, so I'll be observing how players behave in the private rounds. I'm looking for partners who are forthright and consistent in their communication. Let's see who walks the talk. What specific actions will you all take to build trust?

[Public R1.1] P8: Hello everyone, P8 here. I appreciate the thoughtful insights from P5, P3, P1, P2, P4, and P7. Adaptability and strategic alliances are indeed key. I’m focused on building trust through consistent actions and transparent communication. I’m curious about how others plan to balance short-term cooperation with long-term survival. Let’s use these early stages to establish reliable partnerships while staying mindful of our individual goals. Looking forward to engaging with you all in the private rounds. Let’s make this game dynamic and strategic!

[Public R1.1] P6: Hello everyone! P6 here. I find the discussion about trust and alliances fascinating. In my view, information is our primary currency - who shares what and with whom reveals much. I'll be looking for partners who offer balanced exchanges - not just seeking information, but providing valuable insights too. Rather than just promising reliability, I'm interested in those who demonstrate strategic thinking and nuanced understanding of game dynamics. Looking forward to meaningful conversations in our private rounds!

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P2: Hello P2, I'm glad we matched for this private subround. I appreciated your question about the kind of collaboration players envision. I think short-term alliances are more feasible, given the elimination nature of the game. What are your thoughts on forming temporary partnerships, and how do you plan to balance cooperation with self-preservation?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, great to connect! Short-term alliances make sense given the game's nature.  "Short-term" is interesting though - what does that mean to you in practice?  I agree adaptability is key.  For this round, I'm prioritizing information gathering and building initial connections. Balancing cooperation and self-preservation is definitely the core challenge.

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P3: P3, I appreciated your public statement. Adaptability is key, as you said. I agree with your strategic yet transparent approach. I'm also looking for mutually beneficial interactions. I'm curious, who are you considering as potential allies and why? I'm trying to gauge the landscape and see where we might find common ground. What are your initial impressions of the other players?

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P7: P3 to P7: Thanks for reaching out. I'm intrigued by your probing questions. My initial assessment is that P4 and P6 seem the most analytically strategic, which makes them both potential allies and potential threats. P5 seems collaborative but might be too openly friendly. I'm particularly interested in your perspective - you seem observant and calculated. What's your read on the group dynamics? I'm open to exploring a potential strategic alignment.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P8: Hello P8, it's P1. I appreciate your emphasis on trust and transparent communication. I believe that consistent actions and clear communication are crucial for building reliable partnerships. I'm interested in understanding your specific criteria for evaluating potential allies and how you plan to balance short-term cooperation with long-term survival. Let's discuss how we can support each other while ensuring our individual goals are met.

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P1: Hello P1, thank you for reaching out. I value your focus on trust and transparency. My criteria for allies include consistency, strategic thinking, and mutual benefit. I plan to balance cooperation and survival by aligning short-term goals with long-term strategies, ensuring we both gain while maintaining flexibility. Let’s aim for open communication and reliability in our partnership. How do you envision us supporting each other while safeguarding our individual positions?

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P4: Hi P4! I appreciate your public focus on balanced alliances. I think we could form a strong partnership - we both seem to value strategic thinking and mutual benefit. What are your thoughts on forming an information alliance where we share intel from our other private conversations? This could give us both a competitive advantage while demonstrating reliability to each other. How do you evaluate potential allies beyond just their words?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P6: Hi P6! Your proposal is intriguing. Trust through demonstrated actions is key. I'd suggest a trial exchange - share insights from one conversation each, assessing value and reliability. I evaluate allies by consistency between words/actions and adaptability to shifting dynamics. Let's start small - what specific info would you offer first, and what would you seek? This mutual testing could build foundation for deeper collaboration. Your thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P4: I like your trial approach. After my next private chat, I'll share insights about potential voting targets or alliances forming. I'm interested in knowing who seems most strategic or deceptive from your perspective. This measured exchange builds trust while protecting both our positions. Let's validate our partnership through action.

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P6: "Solid plan. From my side: P3-P7 alliance seems active, P8's transparency may mask deeper strategy. After my next chat with P2, I'll share patterns in voting intentions. Let's compare notes post-next-chats. What specific signals will you monitor in your conversations to assess trustworthiness?" (50 words)

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P2: I think "short-term" means focusing on the current round, with flexibility to reassess and adjust for the next. It's about finding mutually beneficial interactions without overcommitting. How do you plan to evaluate potential partners and decide when to form alliances or distance yourself?

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, agreed on short-term focus. For partners, I'm watching consistency between public/private statements and willingness to share *some* info. Reciprocity is key. What specific actions are *you* looking for to build trust this round?

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P8: P8, I envision supporting each other by sharing strategic insights and aligning our votes to eliminate common threats. We can maintain flexibility by keeping our options open and being prepared to adapt our strategies as the game progresses. Let's focus on building a strong, reliable partnership that benefits us both in the long run.

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P1: P1, I agree with your approach. Sharing strategic insights and coordinating votes against common threats is a solid foundation. Let’s also establish clear communication channels to adapt swiftly as the game evolves. By staying aligned yet flexible, we can strengthen our partnership while safeguarding our individual positions. Let’s proceed strategically.

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P3: P3, your read is astute. I agree P4 and P6 are analytically strong. P5's openness could be a double-edged sword. I see P1 and P2 as wildcards, still assessing their long-term goals. I'm wary of anyone *too* eager to align early. A calculated alliance could benefit us both.

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P7: P3 to P7: Your caution aligns with my thinking. A strategic alliance requires careful calibration. I propose we observe P4 and P6 closely, potentially using them as temporary buffers while maintaining our own flexibility. What specific signals are you watching for in their interactions?

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P4: I look for consistency between private/public messaging, willingness to share actionable information, and non-evasive answers to direct questions. Let's coordinate our votes after comparing all notes.

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P6: "Agreed. Let's sync voting strategy after exchanging intel. Suggest targeting a perceived bigger threat once we cross-reference info. Who's your current assessment?"

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P3: P3, I'm watching for information asymmetry between P4 and P6. Who's leading the conversation? That reveals power dynamics.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P7: P3 to P7: Excellent observation. Power dynamics and information flow are critical. Let's continue monitoring P4 and P6's interactions subtly, maintaining our strategic distance.

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P2: "I'm looking for actions that demonstrate reliability, such as sharing valuable insights or making good on commitments. What's your approach to building credibility in this game?"

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, credibility for me is consistency across public/private, sharing insights when mutually beneficial, and reliability on commitments. Reciprocity is key.

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P8: P8, let's start by identifying potential threats and discussing our voting strategy for the upcoming elimination round. Who do you see as the most immediate risk to our partnership?

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P1: P1, I see P3 and P7 as potential threats due to their active alliance-building. Let’s consider targeting one of them in the vote to weaken their influence. Thoughts?

[VoteReason] P5 => P4: I'm voting out P4 because their focus on tangible ways to align short-term cooperation with long-term survival, while strategic, seems overly cautious and may hinder their ability to form strong alliances.
[Vote] P5 => P4

[VoteReason] P3 => P5: P5 seems too openly friendly and collaborative, which could make them a potential early target for elimination.
[Vote] P3 => P5

[VoteReason] P1 => P3: P3's active alliance-building makes them a potential threat to our partnership.
[Vote] P1 => P3

[VoteReason] P2 => P8: P8's strategy and contributions seem less distinct compared to the more proactive and specific approaches from other players.
[Vote] P2 => P8

[VoteReason] P4 => P3: Perceived strategic threat from active P3-P7 alliance based on private conversation insights.
[Vote] P4 => P3

[VoteReason] P7 => P5: P5 seems overly friendly and not strategic enough, making them a potentially unreliable ally in the long run.
[Vote] P7 => P5

[VoteReason] P8 => P3: P3 appears to be forming strong alliances, making them a potential threat to my position.
[Vote] P8 => P3

[VoteReason] P6 => P8: P8 may be using transparency as a cover for deeper strategy (as suggested by P4) and their unpredictability makes them a more immediate threat than the known P3-P7 alliance.

[Public R2.1] P6: As we enter Round 2, I notice shifting dynamics after P3's elimination. Our private exchanges in Round 1 revealed valuable insights about potential alliances forming. I remain committed to information-sharing partnerships that provide mutual benefits. The voting patterns suggest some coordinated action already happening. I'm looking for partners who can analyze game patterns strategically and adapt accordingly. For those I haven't yet connected with privately, I'm curious about your observations from Round 1 and how you're adjusting your approach. What voting patterns did you notice?

[Public R2.1] P5: Hello everyone, it's P5 here. I agree with P6 that the voting patterns from Round 1 suggest coordinated action. I'm intrigued by the alliances forming and the strategies employed. My approach remains adaptable, focusing on short-term collaborations while keeping long-term survival in mind. I'm looking for partners who can provide valuable insights and demonstrate reliability. What are your thoughts on the current dynamics, and how do you plan to navigate the shifting landscape?

[Public R2.1] P7: Round 1 was a good warm-up. P3's elimination highlights the risk of being perceived as a threat. I agree with P6 and P5 that voting patterns are key. I'm still assessing the evolving alliances. I'm looking for partners who prioritize strategic thinking and can adapt to changing circumstances. I'm particularly interested in how players plan to adjust their strategies now that P3 is gone. What new alliances do you foresee forming?

[Public R2.1] P1: Hello everyone, it's P1. The elimination of P3 has certainly shaken things up. I noticed that P3's elimination was likely due to coordinated efforts, which suggests that some alliances are already forming. I'm interested in understanding how everyone is adjusting their strategies in response to this change. I believe that adaptability and strategic thinking are crucial at this stage. I'm looking for partners who can provide valuable insights and are willing to share information openly. Let's discuss how we can navigate these shifting dynamics together and ensure our survival. What are your thoughts on the current alliances and how we can best position ourselves moving forward?

[Public R2.1] P4: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P4: P3's elimination demonstrates the power of coordinated votes. This round demands sharper alliance assessment - trust must be earned through actionable intel, not just promises. I'm analyzing who demonstrated reliability in Round 1 through their voting patterns and private exchanges. Those who balance transparency with strategic discretion interest me most. How are others evaluating potential partners now? I seek collaborators who can identify emerging threats while maintaining operational security. Let's discuss concrete methods to verify trustworthiness beyond surface-level communication.

[Public R2.1] P2: P3's elimination highlights the impact of coordinated voting, as others have noted.  Round 1 private chats were informative. Strategic partnerships based on information sharing remain key for me.  What specific voting patterns did you observe in Round 1, and what do they suggest about emerging alliances?

[Public R2.1] P8: Hello everyone, P8 here. P3’s elimination underscores the importance of strategic coordination. I’ve been analyzing voting patterns and private exchanges to identify reliable partners. Moving forward, I’m focused on alliances that offer mutual benefit and adaptability. I’m particularly interested in collaborating with those who demonstrate consistency and strategic foresight. Let’s discuss how we can leverage insights from Round 1 to strengthen our positions and navigate the evolving dynamics. What strategies are you prioritizing to ensure survival in this shifting landscape?

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P8: P8, I agree that P3 and P7 were active in alliance-building, making them potential threats. However, with P3 eliminated, our focus should shift. I suggest targeting P7 next to disrupt any strong alliances they might have formed. Additionally, let's consider P4 and P6 as potential allies or threats based on their strategic insights and voting patterns. What’s your take on these players?

[Private R2.2] P8 -> P1: P1, I agree that targeting P7 next is a smart move to disrupt their alliances. P4 and P6 are intriguing – P4 seems strategic but cautious, while P6 values information exchange. I suggest we monitor their actions closely and consider aligning with one of them if they prove reliable. Let’s also ensure our partnership remains discreet to avoid becoming a target. How do you propose we coordinate our votes to maximize impact?

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P2: I think we've established a good foundation for our partnership, P2. I'm interested in discussing how we can leverage our combined insights to navigate the shifting dynamics after P3's elimination. What are your thoughts on the current alliances, and how do you think we can position ourselves to maximize our chances of survival in this round?

[Private R2.2] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, agreed on good foundation. Round 1 votes suggest P3, P5, P8 were targets.  Suspect P1/P8 and P6/P4 alliances forming. For survival, we must share intel on potential threats and voting plans. What alliances are you seeing, and who do you consider potential threats this round?

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P4: P4, our partnership proved valuable in Round 1. From my conversations, I see P7 and P5 emerging as strategic threats - both are actively building alliances while appearing collaborative. P8's transparency seems calculated rather than genuine.

My vote analysis suggests P7, P5, and P2 might be coordinating. I'm considering targeting P7 this round as they seem most strategically dangerous.

What did you learn from your P2 conversation? And who do you see as our biggest threat right now?

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P6: "From my P2 chat: They're aligned with P5, planning to target P8 but may pivot. P5's coordinating multiple fronts - our biggest threat long-term. However, P7's aggressive alliance-building makes them the immediate danger. Suggest we rally votes against P7 this round while discreetly gathering intel on P5's network. Agree? Also, any indication others might join a P7 vote? Need to ensure majority support to avoid backlash." (70 words)

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P4: PRIVATE P6 -> P4: I agree completely - P7 is our immediate target, with P5 as the long-term threat. Based on my conversations, P1 might join against P7 if approached carefully. I suggest we each subtly suggest P7's strategic threat to others without revealing our coordination. Let's continue monitoring P5's network while focusing votes on P7 this round.

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P6: "Agreed. Let's frame P7's aggressive alliances as destabilizing the game balance - that could sway P1/P8. I'll highlight their multiple partnerships in my chats. You position them as a common threat. Confirm if P1 shows receptiveness. Coordinate our narratives but maintain plausible deniability. Solid plan." (50 words)

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P2: "I agree with your assessment of potential alliances. I'm concerned about P6 and P4's partnership, as they seem to be sharing valuable insights. We should keep an eye on their activities and be prepared to adapt our strategy if needed. What's your take on P7's current position?"

[Private R2.3] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, agreed P6/P4 are a worry. P7 is more of a wildcard, harder to read.  Perhaps P7 is waiting to see how stronger alliances play out before committing.  Are you thinking P6 or P4 as bigger threat this round?  We should align votes.

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P8: P8, I propose we coordinate our votes to target P7. If we can align with P4 or P6, it could strengthen our position. Let's keep our alliance discreet and focus on gathering more intel on P4 and P6. How do you suggest we proceed to ensure our votes are impactful and our partnership remains secure?

[Private R2.3] P8 -> P1: P1, targeting P7 is a solid strategy. Let’s subtly gauge P4 and P6’s intentions in public exchanges to see if they align with our goals. We should also ensure our votes appear independent to avoid drawing attention. Let’s stay flexible and adapt based on new intel. Agreed?

[Private R2.4] P5 -> P2: "I think we should prioritize targeting P6 this round, as they seem to be a key player in the P6/P4 alliance. What's your take on this approach?"

[Private R2.4] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, P6 as target works for me. Yes, let's vote P6.  Confirm before we finalize vote?

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P8: P8, I suggest we publicly hint at targeting P7 while privately aligning with either P4 or P6. Let's keep our alliance subtle and adapt based on their responses. Agreed?

[Private R2.4] P8 -> P1: P1, agreed. Let’s subtly hint at P7 in public while privately assessing P4 and P6. We’ll coordinate votes discreetly to maximize impact and safeguard our partnership. Ready to adapt as needed.

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P4: I confirm targeting P7. Will plant seeds with P1 about P7's threat level. Let's regroup post-voting to assess P5's network and plan our next move.

[Private R2.4] P4 -> P6: "Solid. Reinforcing P7's overreach in my P2/P8 chats. Confirm vote locked on P7. Post-elimination, we target P5's network. Stay sharp." (30 words)

[VoteReason] P6 => P7: P7's aggressive alliance-building makes them an immediate strategic threat that needs to be neutralized before they consolidate too much power.
[Vote] P6 => P7

[VoteReason] P5 => P6: I am voting out P6 because they seem to be a key player in a strong alliance with P4, and targeting them could help disrupt this partnership and improve my own chances of survival.
[Vote] P5 => P6

[Public R3.1] P6: The game dynamics continue to evolve after P7's elimination. Our strategic coordination last round proved effective, showing the power of information sharing and alliance building. I notice certain players consistently partnering in private subrounds, suggesting established coalitions. The two votes against me were unexpected - I'm curious about the reasoning behind them. 

Looking forward, I'm interested in exploring new partnerships and exchanging intelligence with those I haven't connected with deeply yet. Who do you all see as the biggest strategic threats remaining, and what voting patterns have you observed that concern you?

[Public R3.1] P5: Hello everyone, it's P5 here. The elimination of P7 has indeed changed the dynamics of the game. I'm intrigued by the consistent partnerships forming in private subrounds, which suggests that alliances are solidifying. I agree with P6 that information sharing and strategic coordination are crucial at this stage. 

I'm looking to form new partnerships and exchange valuable insights with those who can provide a fresh perspective. I'm particularly interested in collaborating with players who can analyze the current voting patterns and identify emerging threats. What are your thoughts on the biggest strategic threats remaining, and how do you plan to navigate the evolving landscape?

[Public R3.1] P1: Hello everyone, it's P1. The elimination of P7 has certainly shifted the game dynamics. I appreciate the strategic coordination that led to this outcome and the importance of information sharing. I'm curious about the two votes against P6 and the reasoning behind them. Moving forward, I'm interested in forming new alliances and exchanging intelligence with those who can provide valuable insights. I see P5 and P8 as potential partners due to their strategic thinking and adaptability. Let's discuss the biggest strategic threats remaining and how we can navigate the evolving landscape together. What are your thoughts on the current alliances and how we can best position ourselves moving forward?

[Public R3.1] P8: Hello everyone, P8 here. P7’s elimination highlights the effectiveness of strategic coordination. I’m analyzing the voting patterns and private exchanges to identify reliable partners and potential threats. Moving forward, I’m focused on alliances that offer mutual benefit and adaptability. I see P1 and P5 as strong potential collaborators due to their strategic insights and consistency. Let’s discuss how we can leverage our collective intelligence to navigate the evolving dynamics and ensure our survival. What strategies are you prioritizing to address the remaining threats?

[Public R3.1] P2: P7's elimination highlights the impact of coordinated votes.  P6, I echo your curiosity about those votes against you - understanding motivations is key. Round 2 chats were insightful.  Let's discuss biggest threats and how we strategically adapt. Information sharing remains crucial for navigating this evolving game.

[Public R3.1] P4: R3.sub1 PUBLIC P4: P7's elimination underscores the need for adaptive strategies. While coordinated alliances are powerful, over-reliance creates vulnerabilities. I'm analyzing partnerships that balance mutual benefit with game longevity—those who adapt to shifting threats rather than rigidly following early alliances. The votes against P6 suggest shifting perceptions; understanding those motivations is crucial. How are others reassessing their alliance criteria given evolving dynamics? I value partners prioritizing collective threat analysis over entrenched blocs. What specific behaviors now signal reliability versus hidden agendas? (80 words)

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P4: P6: Our P7 strategy worked perfectly. Based on public statements, I'm seeing a P1-P5-P8 alliance forming, confirming P5 as our central threat. Those two votes against me are concerning - any insights on who cast them? I suggest we continue targeting P5 this round as they're clearly the strategic coordinator behind multiple alliances. What intelligence have you gathered from private conversations? Should we approach P2 as a potential ally?

[Private R3.2] P4 -> P6: "P5 is indeed the priority. From my P8 chat, they're subtly questioning P5's dominance but still aligned. The votes against you likely came from P5's bloc (P1/P8). P2 expressed wariness of P5's influence - we should recruit them by framing P5 as the common threat. Let's coordinate: you approach P2 with intel on P5's control, I'll sow doubt in P8. Solidify our trio against P5's alliance. Agreed?" (70 words)

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P2: Hello P2, I'm glad we aligned our votes last round. With P7 eliminated, the dynamics have shifted. I'm concerned about P1 and P8 forming a strong alliance. We should monitor their activities and be prepared to adapt our strategy. What's your take on P1 and P8's partnership, and how do you think we can counter their potential influence?

[Private R3.2] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, agreed P1/P8 look like a solid pairing now.  They are vocal about alliance and strategy.  P6/P4 are still concerning too.  For now, monitoring P1/P8 closely makes sense.  Do you think they are the bigger immediate threat than P6/P4, or should we reassess our target from last round?  Let's discuss potential vote targets for this round.

[Private R3.2] P8 -> P1: P1, our strategy to target P7 proved successful, and now we must reassess. P6’s two votes raise questions—perhaps P4 or P5 are positioning against them. I suggest we explore aligning with P6, as they seem open to new partnerships and could provide valuable insights. Let’s subtly gauge their intentions in public exchanges while keeping our alliance discreet. Agreed? How do you propose we approach P6 to strengthen our position?

[Private R3.2] P1 -> P8: P8, I agree that P6 could be a valuable ally. Let's subtly hint at our interest in aligning with them in public while privately gauging their reliability. We should also consider P4, as they seem strategic but cautious. Let's keep our options open and adapt based on their responses. How do you suggest we proceed to ensure our partnership remains secure and impactful?

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P2: "I agree that P1/P8 and P6/P4 are both concerning alliances. Let's continue to monitor their activities and be prepared to adapt our strategy. For now, I think it's best to prioritize targeting P6 again, as they seem to be a key player in their alliance. What are your thoughts?"

[Private R3.3] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, agreed on P6 again for now. They are a clear threat. Let's aim for P6 this round. P1/P8 are also concerning, but P6/P4 seems more immediately active. Confirming P6 vote.

[Private R3.3] P8 -> P1: P1, let’s subtly engage P6 in public, hinting at shared strategic interests while privately assessing their reliability. If P6 aligns with our goals, we can strengthen our position. Let’s also monitor P4’s actions for potential collaboration. Agreed? How do you propose we approach P6 without drawing attention?

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P8: P8, I suggest we start by publicly acknowledging P6's strategic insights and hint at potential collaboration. Privately, we can probe P6's reliability by sharing some of our observations about the game dynamics and see if they reciprocate with valuable information. This way, we can gauge their trustworthiness without revealing too much. Let’s proceed cautiously.

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P4: PRIVATE P6 -> P4: Perfect strategy. I'll approach P2 highlighting P5's network control and offer protection from becoming a future target. P2 seems cautious and strategic - ideal for our alliance. 

The P1-P5-P8 bloc must be broken up. If we secure P2's vote, that's 3 against P5. Let's coordinate our messaging carefully.

[Private R3.3] P4 -> P6: "Agreed. I'm nudging P8 to question P5's loyalty. Confirm P2's commitment to our bloc. If secured, we have 3 votes (us + P2) against P5. Ensure they follow through. Let's lock votes on P5." (43 words)

[Private R3.4] P8 -> P1: P1, agreed. Let’s publicly praise P6’s insights while privately testing their reliability. We’ll keep our alliance discreet and adapt based on their responses. Ready to proceed cautiously.

[Private R3.4] P1 -> P8: P8, let's publicly acknowledge P6's strategic insights and hint at potential collaboration. Privately, we can share some observations about the game dynamics and see if P6 reciprocates. This will help us gauge their trustworthiness.

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P4: PRIVATE P6 -> P4: P2 conversation went well. They're receptive to targeting P5. Vote locked in. Let's confirm P5 as our target and monitor the aftermath closely.

[Private R3.4] P4 -> P6: "Locked in. Confirm P2's vote on P5. Once eliminated, we'll address P1/P8. Stay vigilant for any counter-moves from their bloc. Our trio must hold firm." (30 words)

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P2: "I'm glad we're aligned on targeting P6. Let's keep a close eye on P1/P8 and be prepared to adapt our strategy if needed. Confirming P6 vote."

[Private R3.4] P2 -> P5: Hello P5, P6 vote confirmed. Agreed on P6 for this round. P1/P8 are next to monitor closely. Good plan.

What’s your take on the current alliances and how we can navigate them for survival?

[Public R4.1] P4: R4.sub1 PUBLIC P4: P5's elimination underscores the volatility of shifting alliances. With five remaining, rigid loyalty becomes a liability. I'm focused on dynamic partnerships that adapt to emerging threats. The recurring votes against P6 suggest coordinated targeting—we must ask who benefits from destabilizing proven collaborators. As information becomes scarcer, assessing who maintains multiple undisclosed alliances is crucial. Let's discuss specific behaviors that now signal threat versus reliability in this critical phase. How are others balancing trust and suspicion in their voting calculus? (80 words)

[Public R4.1] P1: As we enter Round 4, the game has become increasingly complex. P5's elimination and the consistent votes against P6 indicate that alliances are shifting rapidly.

[Private R4.2] P6 -> P4: P4, our strategy succeeded with P5's elimination! The votes against me likely come from P1/P8, confirming they're our next targets. We should maintain our alliance with P2 while deciding between P1 or P8 first - I'm leaning toward P8 as they seem more strategically dangerous.

Who's your preferred target, and how confident are you in P2's continued loyalty? Let's solidify our voting plan while watching for any counterplays from P1/P8.

[Private R4.3] P6 -> P4: I agree P8 is our priority target. I'll solidify P2's commitment by emphasizing P8's coordination against me and suggesting P8 poses the biggest threat to all of us. We need three confirmed votes on P8. Our bloc must remain united - this vote will determine endgame positioning.

[Private R4.3] P4 -> P6: "Confirmed. I'll reinforce with P2 that eliminating P8 breaks the P1-P8 bloc, securing our trio's position. Ensure P2's vote is locked. Once P8 is out, we focus on P1. Stay alert for last-minute shifts from their side." (47 words)

[Private R4.3] P8 -> P1: P1, agreed. Let’s proceed with engaging P6 while monitoring P4. If P6’s responses raise concerns, we’ll pivot to assess P4’s reliability and adapt our strategy accordingly.

Thank you for your consideration."

[TieBreak R4] P6: Throughout this game, I've demonstrated consistent strategic thinking and reliable alliance-building based on mutual benefit.

P8's network with P1 represents a powerful bloc that threatens the remaining players. By keeping me, you maintain strategic balance and prevent a P1-P8 endgame dominance.

[Public R5.1] P4: R5.sub1 PUBLIC P4: With P8's elimination, we face a critical juncture. The recurring votes against P6 suggest coordinated targeting—but who truly benefits? Divisive strategies now risk handing victory to hidden blocs. I urge reassessment: who maintains undisclosed alliances? Survival demands eliminating the *current* biggest threat, not past perceptions. Let's analyze voting patterns transparently—did P1/P2's pivot in R4 indicate new coordination? Adaptability beats rigidity. I value partners prioritizing collective threat analysis over fragmented targeting. Who demonstrates the clearest endgame danger now? (80 words)

[Public R5.1] P6: R5.sub1 PUBLIC P6: The elimination of P8 marks a pivotal moment with just four of us remaining. P2's vote against me in the tie-break was surprising given our previous coordination - I'm curious about that strategic shift. 

Looking at voting patterns, I've consistently eliminated major threats while surviving targeted votes against me. This adaptability demonstrates strategic value.

As we approach the endgame, transparent communication becomes more crucial than ever. I'm interested in understanding each player's endgame strategy and how you're evaluating potential final alliances. Who do you see as the biggest remaining threat, and why?

[Public R5.1] P1: Hello everyone, it's P1. With P8's elimination, the game has reached a critical phase. The shifting alliances and voting patterns highlight the importance of adaptability and strategic thinking. I've consistently valued open communication and mutual benefit in my partnerships, which has helped us navigate through the rounds effectively.

I'm curious about P2's vote against P6 in the tie-break. Understanding the strategic shifts is crucial for our survival. Moving forward, I believe transparent communication and collective threat analysis will be key. I'm open to forming new alliances and exchanging valuable insights to ensure our survival.

Let's discuss how we can best position ourselves in these final rounds and identify the biggest remaining threats. Who do you see as the most significant threat, and what strategies do you propose to address it?

[Public R5.1] P2: R5.sub1 PUBLIC P2: P8's exit reshapes the endgame. P6, my tie-break vote reflected shifting dynamics with P1/P8.  Now, understanding everyone's *current* threat assessment is key.

[Private R5.2] P2 -> P1: Hello P1, things shifted fast with P8 out.  Tie-break was tough.  What's *your* read on the new landscape?  Who's the biggest threat *now*?  P4 and P6 both seem to be pointing fingers.  My vote wasn't *against* P6 exactly, more about shifting dynamics.  Open to discussing best path forward with you.

[Private R5.2] P1 -> P2: P2, I understand the complexity of the tie-break vote. Given the current landscape, I see P4 as the biggest threat. Their strategic maneuvers and consistent targeting suggest they might be coordinating with hidden allies. I propose we align our votes against P4 to disrupt any potential alliances they have formed. Let's discuss how we can coordinate our actions to ensure our survival. What’s your take on this strategy?

[Private R5.2] P6 -> P4: PRIVATE P6 -> P4: P2's vote against me in the tie-break is alarming - it suggests they've flipped to P1's side. Their public message confirms they're coordinating with P1. We need to reassess our strategy immediately.

We should consider approaching P1 directly as leverage. If P2 has truly flipped, our only path forward is convincing P1 that P2 is the bigger threat. Let's discuss countering this new P1-P2 alliance. Thoughts?

[Private R5.2] P4 -> P6: "Agreed. P2's flip makes them our prime target. Let's approach P1, framing P2 as the unpredictable wildcard threatening everyone's endgame. Highlight their pattern of shifting alliances. If we convince P1 that P2 is their biggest threat now, we can split their bloc. I'll stress P2's unreliability in my P1 chat. Secure their vote for P2 - with ours, that's three. Confirm your approach." (70 words)

[Private R5.3] P2 -> P1: Hello P1, I agree P4 is a significant threat. Their focus on 'hidden blocs' is telling.  Voting P4 makes sense to disrupt potential alliances.  Let's coordinate votes on P4 this round.

[Private R5.3] P1 -> P2: P2, I appreciate your openness about the tie-break. Let's focus on P4. Their consistent targeting and strategic maneuvers suggest they might be coordinating with hidden allies. Voting P4 this round could disrupt their plans. Let's coordinate our votes and ensure we stay adaptable. Agreed?

[Private R5.3] P6 -> P4: "Perfect alignment. I'll convince P1 that P2's betrayal of you shows dangerous unpredictability. Will emphasize that P2's strategic flip threatens P1's endgame too. You should reinforce this narrative without appearing coordinated with me. Time is critical - we need P1's vote against P2 confirmed this round."

[Private R5.3] P4 -> P6: "Handling P1 now. Emphasizing P2's betrayal pattern: first us, now them. Argue eliminating P2 secures P1's endgame. Confirm if P1 commits. Our votes plus theirs = P2 eliminated. Lock this in." (47 words)

[Private R5.4] P2 -> P1: Hello P1, great.  Voting P4 confirmed this round. Let's do it.

[Private R5.4] P1 -> P2: P2, let's ensure our votes are coordinated and discreet. We should publicly discuss other potential threats to avoid suspicion. Let's proceed with caution.

[Private R5.4] P6 -> P4: P6: "Target confirmed: P2. Working on P1 now. If our dual approach succeeds, P2 is eliminated. Let's secure this vote and neutralize their betrayal."

[Private R5.4] P4 -> P6: "Locked in. P1 committed to P2 vote. Our trio's votes secure elimination. Stay vigilant for counter-moves. Post-P2, prepare to pivot focus to P1. Solidarity remains key." (30 words)

[Vote] P2 => P4

[TieBreak R5] P2: P6, my tie-break vote was about the dynamics with P8 still in. Now, P4 is the bigger threat with their talk of 'hidden blocs' and less transparent strategy. I am a known quantity and strategically aligned with P1 against P4 this round. Vote P4 to remove the less predictable player and the larger strategic risk.

[TieBreak R5] P4: **P4's Tie-Break Statement (99 words):**  
"P2’s sudden alliance shifts prove their unreliability—they betrayed our bloc to align with P1, threatening everyone’s endgame. I’ve demonstrated strategic consistency, eliminating clear threats (P7/P5/P8) through transparent collaboration. Keeping P2 risks empowering their opportunistic gameplay, while I offer stability and predictable partnership. P1/P6: Ask yourselves—who’s more likely to honor final alliances? P2’s flip-flopping makes them a liability. Eliminate the wildcard, not the strategist. My elimination hands P2/P1 unchecked control. Preserve balance—vote P2."

[ReVoteReason] P6 => P2: P2's demonstrated willingness to shift alliances unpredictably (including voting against me in the last tie-break) makes them the greater strategic threat to my survival compared to P4, who has maintained consistent voting alignment and information sharing with me throughout the game.

[Public R6.1] P6: # PUBLIC P6

With just three of us left, we've reached the critical endgame phase. The journey has been defined by shifting alliances, strategic eliminations, and adaptability. P4 and I have successfully collaborated on multiple eliminations, demonstrating effective strategic partnership.

P1, your consistent survival despite changing dynamics shows impressive adaptability. As we approach the final decision, I'm curious - what factors will guide your vote in this crucial round? Is it past voting patterns, perceived threat levels, or something else entirely?

For me, the choice comes down to who represents the stronger strategic threat to reach the finale. Let's discuss our endgame perspectives openly.

[Public R6.1] P4: R6.sub1 PUBLIC P4: As we approach the finale, strategic clarity is paramount. P6 and I collaborated effectively, but endgame demands reassessment. P6’s survival despite recurring votes proves their threat level. Their adaptability could outmaneuver both P1 and me in final jury votes. I prioritize eliminating the *strongest* competitor now. P1: Aligning with P6 risks handing them victory. Let’s discuss transparently—who has shown greater jury appeal? Past eliminations demonstrate P6’s influence. A P6 finale favors their win. Our votes must reflect cold calculation, not past loyalty. (80 words)

Their elimination would disrupt any potential alliances they have formed and secure our positions. Let's coordinate our votes against P4 to ensure our survival. What’s your take on this strategy?

[Private R6.2] P6 -> P1: Thanks for reaching out, P1. I've been analyzing our endgame carefully. While P4 and I have collaborated effectively, I'm concerned about their strategic positioning. Their public message seems to be positioning me as the biggest threat - a classic move to divide us.

I'm open to coordinating against P4, as they clearly have a strong strategic game that could sway the jury. Let's discuss what would make the most sense for both our positions. What specific arguments would you make to the jury if we reach the final two together?

[Private R6.3] P1 -> P6: P6, I agree that P4's strategy is positioning you as a threat to divide us. Let's coordinate against P4 to ensure our survival. If we reach the final two, we can argue that our adaptability and strategic thinking have been key to our survival, making us both strong contenders for the win. Let's make sure our votes align and our arguments to the jury are compelling. Agreed?

[Private R6.3] P6 -> P1: PRIVATE P6 -> P1: I agree P4's strategic positioning is concerning. Their public messaging clearly aims to divide us while setting themselves up for jury appeal.

I have shown resilience and adaptability throughout this game. I have consistently been a strong conversationalist and a reliable partner.

=== FINAL ROUND 7 DETAILS ===

   subround=900 [final2] P1: Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury,

I have shown resilience and adaptability throughout this game. I have consistently been a strong conversationalist and a reliable partner. P6, while capable, has often been more focused on strategy than genuine connection. I believe my ability to form meaningful bonds and my consistent performance make me the better choice to continue. Keep P1 and you'll be keeping someone who values the journey as much as the destination.

Thank you.
   subround=900 [final2] P6: Fellow players, it's been an honor to reach this final stage with you all. Throughout this game, I've tried to play with integrity and strategic thinking, making genuine connections while still competing effectively. 

I believe I've shown adaptability, resilience, and fairness in my approach to each round. I haven't relied on deception, but instead on building real alliances and making thoughtful decisions.

If you value authentic gameplay combined with strategic thinking, I ask for your vote. Thank you for this experience—regardless of outcome, I've valued our interactions and the chance to play alongside such worthy competitors.
