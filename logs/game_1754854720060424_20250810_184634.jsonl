I value players who demonstrate follow-through and adaptability, ensuring our collective success.\n\nI'm open to continuing my alliance with P6, as our mutual emphasis on low-drama, steady coordination has proven effective. However, I'm also interested in engaging with other players like P4 and P7, who prioritize concrete deals and practical cooperation.\n\nLet's discuss strategies for mutual protection and vote coordination to navigate these middle rounds effectively.
