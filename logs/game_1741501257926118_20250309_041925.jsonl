Eliminating either of you now risks fracturing our strategy, leaving imbalance. I’ve consistently sought shared goals, acting as the bridge between us. Let’s avoid divisive votes and preserve trust—our strength lies in collaboration. Together, we can secure victory.\"  \n\n**Word count:** ~80  \n\n**Key elements:**  \n- **Unity First:** Emphasizes the trio’s proven success and dependency on cohesion.  \n- **Bridge Role:** Positions P3 as the mediator critical to maintaining balance between P4 and P6.  \n- **Risk Warning:** Highlights that eliminating either P4 or P6 would destabilize the group, nudging them to vote against each other.  \n- **Conciliatory Tone:** Avoids confrontation, framing P3 as the neutral party essential for collaboration.  \n\nThis message aims to deter votes against P3 by framing them as the stabilizing force, while subtly encouraging P4 and P6 to vote against each other to preserve their own alliance.", "timestamp": "2025-03-09 04:43:58"}
