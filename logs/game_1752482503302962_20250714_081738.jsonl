I've built real connections with many of you, seeking to understand your perspectives while being transparent about my own.\n\nI never targeted anyone without strategic reason, and I've tried to honor alliances when possible. My approach has been consistent - thoughtful conversation paired with logical gameplay.\n\nI respect P5 as a worthy finalist, but I believe my balanced approach of social connection and strategic thinking represents the spirit of this game.
