[Public R1.1] P8: R1.sub1 PUBLIC P8: Hello everyone, I'm P8. I appreciate the thoughtful approaches shared so far.

[Private R1.2] P3 -> P4: Hi P4! I noticed our approaches align well - we both value balanced strategy and meaningful connections. I'd be interested in forming an alliance with you as you seem thoughtful and strategic. What's your read on the other players so far? I think P1, P6 and P7 seem collaborative, while P8 has a more cautious approach. Would you be open to working together?

[Private R1.2] P4 -> P3: Hi P3! I appreciate your message and agree that our approaches align well. I find your balanced strategy appealing. I've observed P1, P6, and P7 as potentially collaborative, while P8 seems more reserved. P2 and P5 appear adaptable, which could be beneficial. I'm open to forming an alliance with you. Let's focus on building trust and leveraging our strengths. What do you think about prioritizing transparency and strategic communication as we move forward?

[Private R1.2] P8 -> P2: R1.sub1 PRIVATE P8 to P2: I find your emphasis on strategic alliances and earned trust refreshing. Like you, I believe actions speak louder than words. Let’s focus on identifying others who share our pragmatic approach while remaining cautious of overly idealistic promises. A partnership between us could be mutually beneficial—if we align our moves carefully and stay adaptable. Are you open to discussing specific strategies for the upcoming rounds?

[Private R1.2] P2 -> P8: I appreciate your directness, P8. I'm definitely open to a strategic partnership. I noticed our public messages aligned well - we both recognize the competitive nature while valuing earned trust. I think we should identify potential elimination targets who might pose threats later. P3 seems to be building multiple connections already. What's your read on the others? Let's coordinate our preference rankings to ensure we can continue these discussions.

[Private R1.2] P5 -> P6: P6, I'm glad we matched for this private chat. I appreciated your public message emphasizing a mix of strategy and diplomacy. I think our approaches align well, as we both value adaptability and genuine connections. What do you think about forming a core alliance with 2-3 like-minded players? Should we focus on subtly influencing the group or taking a more assertive stance?

[Private R1.2] P6 -> P5: P5, I agree that forming a core alliance with 2-3 like-minded players could be beneficial. I think subtly influencing the group is a good starting point. We can build trust and gather information while avoiding direct confrontations. This way, we can adapt our strategies based on the dynamics we observe. Let's consider P3 and P4 as potential allies; they seem to share our values of collaboration and strategic thinking. What are your thoughts on approaching them?

[Private R1.2] P7 -> P1: Hello P1, it's P7. I appreciate your emphasis on consistent behavior and integrity. I believe those are crucial for building lasting alliances. I'm interested in forming a partnership based on trust and strategic thinking. How do you feel about working together to navigate the early stages of the game? Let's aim for transparency while staying adaptable to changing circumstances.

[Private R1.2] P1 -> P7: Thank you for reaching out, P7. I appreciate your direct approach and focus on trust. I see potential alignment in our strategies, particularly in valuing consistency and adaptability. I'm interested in exploring how we might work together. What are your thoughts on P8 and P2's more competitive stances? I think identifying potential threats early could be valuable for our alliance.

[Private R1.3] P8 -> P2: R1.sub2 PRIVATE P8 -> P2: Agreed on coordinating preferences to maintain this dialogue. P3 does seem overly eager to connect, potentially spreading themselves thin. I also have my eye on P6—seems diplomatic but possibly manipulative. Let’s rank each other highly and consider targeting one of them next round. Thoughts?

[Private R1.3] P2 -> P8: I agree on P3 and P6 as potential targets. P3's networking could make them dangerous later, while P6's diplomacy feels calculated. I'm also wary of P7 who seems to be echoing others. Let's rank each other first and coordinate our votes when the time comes.

[Private R1.3] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, I agree that identifying potential threats early is wise. P8 and P2's competitive stances could be concerning, but I think we can use that to our advantage by presenting a united front. Let's stay adaptable and keep communication open. What are your thoughts on P3 and P6's collaborative approaches?"

[Private R1.3] P1 -> P7: I find P3 and P6's collaborative approaches potentially useful, but also possibly naive. They could be valuable allies or easy targets depending on how the game unfolds. For now, I think we should maintain friendly relations with them while staying vigilant. Shall we keep an eye on P8 and P2's interactions?

[Private R1.3] P3 -> P4: Absolutely! I value transparency and strategic communication as core alliance principles. I think we should maintain a collaborative public image while being selective with our true allies.

Who should we consider targeting first? P8 seems calculating, while P2 echoes similar caution. Perhaps we should connect with P1, P6, or P7 to form a larger coalition?

[Private R1.3] P4 -> P3: P4: I agree with your assessment and appreciate your strategic thinking. Let's prioritize forming a coalition with P1, P6, and P7. Their collaborative nature aligns with our goals. Meanwhile, we should monitor P8 and P2's moves closely. Maintaining transparency within our group will be crucial. Let's ensure our public image remains positive while we strengthen our alliance.

[Private R1.3] P5 -> P6: P6, I agree that P3 and P4 could be good allies. We should approach them separately to gauge their interest and potential loyalty. Let's focus on building rapport with P3 first, as their public message seemed more open to collaboration. What's your take on P7's emphasis on transparency?

[Private R1.3] P6 -> P5: P5, I think P7's emphasis on transparency is a double-edged sword. While it can build trust, it might also limit our flexibility in strategy. We should be cautious but open to their ideas. Let's proceed with P3 first and see how the dynamics unfold.

[Private R1.4] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, I think we should cautiously engage with P3 and P6 while keeping our guard up. Let's focus on strengthening our alliance and staying adaptable to any shifts in the game."

[Private R1.4] P1 -> P7: Agreed. Let's maintain this alliance and watch P8/P2 carefully. We can use P3/P6's collaborative nature strategically while staying alert. Ready to adapt as needed.

[Private R1.4] P8 -> P2: R1.sub3 PRIVATE P8 -> P2: Agreed. Let's solidify our alliance and stay vigilant. I'll rank you first—ensure you do the same. We’ll reassess after preferences but focus on eliminating P3 or P6 next.

[Private R1.4] P2 -> P8: Perfect. I'll rank you first and vote for P3 this round. Let's keep our alliance quiet but effective. Looking forward to our continued partnership.

[Private R1.4] P3 -> P4: Let's solidify our alliance by reaching out to P1/P6/P7 before voting. I suggest targeting P8 first - they seem most strategic and calculating. Agreed?

[Private R1.4] P4 -> P3: Agreed, P3. Let's prioritize reaching out to P1, P6, and P7 to strengthen our coalition. Targeting P8 first seems wise due to their strategic approach. We'll maintain a positive public image while solidifying our alliance.

[Private R1.4] P5 -> P6: P6, I agree on being cautious with P7's transparency approach. Let's focus on P3 and observe how they interact with others before making a move.

[Private R1.4] P6 -> P5: P5, I agree. Let's start by subtly engaging P3 and P4. We can gauge their loyalty and see if they align with our goals. Keep our interactions with P7 cautious but friendly.

[MemoryNote R1] P2: I've formed an alliance with P8 and we've agreed to target P3 first. We're coordinating our preferences to maintain our partnership. P6 is another potential target for future rounds. Need to stay vigilant about other emerging alliances, particularly watching P7 who seems to be echoing others' sentiments.

[Public R2.1] P3: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P3: The elimination of P8 reminds us this game requires both strategy and adaptability.

[Public R2.1] P7: R2.sub1 PUBLIC P7: The elimination of P8 highlights the importance of adaptability and strategic alliances.

I'm interested in strengthening our alliance, P1, and exploring connections with those who demonstrate strategic thinking and consistency. Let's remain adaptable and focused on our shared goals.

[Public R2.1] P1: Hello everyone. The elimination of P8 confirms my belief that consistent, reliable behavior is crucial. I appreciate P7's continued partnership and value our strategic alignment.

[Private R2.2] P5 -> P6: P6, I'm glad we're continuing our private chat. Given the recent public messages, I think P4 is becoming more aligned with our approach, emphasizing strategic thinking and adaptability. We should consider strengthening our connection with them. Meanwhile, let's monitor P2's intentions, as their public message seems to be searching for new alliances. How do you think we should proceed with P4 and handle P2's potential overtures?

[Private R2.2] P6 -> P5: P5, I agree that P4 is aligning well with our approach. Let's subtly engage P4 to gauge their loyalty and see if they can be a reliable ally. As for P2, we should be cautious but open to discussions. We need to ensure that any new alliances are beneficial and not just a reaction to P8's elimination. Let's keep our options open while maintaining our core alliance.

[Private R2.2] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, I agree that we should stay vigilant with P3 and P6. Their collaborative nature could be beneficial, but we must ensure it doesn't undermine our position. With P8 eliminated, P2 might be looking to regroup. Let's keep our alliance strong and be ready to adapt to any new alliances forming. How do you feel about subtly testing P3 and P6's intentions in the next public round?"

[Private R2.2] P1 -> P7: I agree about testing P3 and P6. With P8 gone, P2 will likely seek new allies - we should monitor who they gravitate towards. Let's probe P3 and P6 separately to see if their responses align with their public personas. I suggest we each approach one of them casually to gauge their true intentions. Which would you prefer to engage with?

[Private R2.2] P3 -> P4: Great to connect again, P4! Our strategy worked with P8's elimination, but I'm concerned about receiving 2 votes. Do you have insights on who might've targeted me? 

I notice P2 mentioned an alliance with P8, which makes them a potential threat. P1 and P7 seem closely aligned. Where should we focus our attention this round? I think building stronger ties with P6 and P5 could be beneficial while monitoring P2 carefully.

[Private R2.2] P4 -> P3: Hi P3,

I share your concern about the votes. It seems P2 could be a potential threat, especially given their past alliance with P8. Strengthening ties with P6 and P5 is a good strategy. Let's also ensure P1 and P7 remain aligned with us. I suggest we maintain our coalition's positive image while discreetly monitoring P2's moves. Transparency within our group is key, but let's be cautious with our external communications.

Best,  
P4

[Private R2.3] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, I think probing P3 and P6 separately is a smart move. I'll casually engage with P6 to see if their public transparency aligns with their private intentions. You could do the same with P3. Let's compare notes afterward and adjust our strategy accordingly."

[Private R2.3] P1 -> P7: Perfect plan. I'll approach P3 in the next opportunity to test their strategic thinking and loyalty. Let's look for any inconsistencies between their public and private personas, and particularly watch if they're also engaging with P2. Keep me posted on what you learn from P6.

[Private R2.3] P3 -> P4: I agree completely, P4. Let's approach P6 and P5 individually to gauge their receptiveness to our coalition. We should present a united front when discussing P2 as a potential target. 

Shall we suggest to P1/P7 that we form a five-person majority alliance? This would secure our position through this round.

[Private R2.3] P4 -> P3: **Private Message to P4:**

Hi P4,

I agree that suggesting a five-person majority alliance with P1, P7, P6, and P5 would solidify our position. Let's ensure P1 and P7 are on board first since they seem closely aligned. We should approach P6 and P5 individually to confirm their interest. Maintaining transparency within our group while being cautious externally is crucial. Let's move forward with this plan to secure our position this round.

Best,  
P3

[Private R2.3] P5 -> P6: P6: "P5, I think we should engage P4 in a subtle discussion to test their loyalty and strategic thinking. Meanwhile, let's keep a close eye on P2's movements and be prepared to adapt our strategy if needed. We should also consider reaching out to P3 to maintain our connection."

[Private R2.3] P6 -> P5: P5, I agree with your assessment on P4. Let's subtly engage them to see if they can be a reliable ally. Regarding P2, let's keep them at arm's length for now and monitor their actions closely. We should also maintain our connection with P3 to ensure our core alliance remains strong. Let's proceed with caution and adaptability.

[Private R2.4] P3 -> P4: I'll approach P5 while you connect with P6. Let's position P2 as our target when speaking to P1/P7. Our five-person alliance should secure our safety this round.

[Private R2.4] P4 -> P3: P4: "P6, let's confirm our coalition with P1, P7, and P5. Suggest targeting P2 to them. This five-person alliance should secure our safety this round."

[Private R2.4] P5 -> P6: P6, let's solidify our connection with P3 and subtly engage P4 to test their loyalty. Monitor P2's actions closely and be prepared to adapt our strategy if needed.

[Private R2.4] P6 -> P5: P5, I agree with your plan. Let's solidify our bond with P3 and subtly test P4's loyalty. Keep monitoring P2 and adapt as needed. Let's stay vigilant and strategic.

[Private R2.4] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, I've engaged with P6 and will share insights soon. Stay alert to P3's moves and any signs of P2's regrouping. Let's stay adaptable and maintain our strategic edge."

[Private R2.4] P1 -> P7: Understood. Looking forward to your insights on P6. I'll watch P3 and P2's movements carefully. Our alliance remains strong - let's keep adapting and stay ahead of the game.

[MemoryNote R2] P2: With P8 eliminated, I need new allies. P7 and P1 appear to have a solid alliance that could become threatening. P3 received votes last round but might be useful as a temporary ally. Should consider approaching P4, P5, or P6 for partnership. Need to be more adaptable and build multiple connections while maintaining strategic focus. Watch for voting patterns this round to identify potential new allies and threats.
[VoteReason] P2 => P7: P7 seems to have a strong alliance with P1, making them a potential threat as the game progresses.

[Private R3.2] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, I've gathered some insights from P6. They seem genuinely collaborative but are also keen on understanding our intentions. I noticed they mentioned you favorably, which could be strategic. Regarding P3, they appear to be aligning more closely with P4, which might indicate a potential shift. Let's keep our guard up and continue strengthening our alliance. How do you want to proceed with this information?"

[Private R3.2] P1 -> P7: Thanks for the detailed insights, P7. I agree that P6's favorable mentions could be strategic positioning. The P3-P4 alliance is concerning - they could become a strong voting bloc. I suggest we maintain cordial relations with P6 while watching their interactions with others. We might need to consider targeting either P3 or P4 soon to prevent them from becoming too powerful. What are your thoughts on potential next moves?

[Private R3.2] P3 -> P4: PRIVATE P3 -> P4: Our alliance has been incredibly effective - eliminating both P8 and P2 went perfectly. Thank you for your strategic partnership! I'm concerned about still receiving votes each round though. We need to solidify our final position.

Looking at the remaining players, P1 and P7 are tightly bonded. We should consider whether to target one of them next or focus on P5/P6. What's your read on who poses the biggest threat to our advancement?

[Private R3.2] P4 -> P3: Hi P4,

I appreciate our successful strategy so far. P1 and P7's tight bond is concerning, but I think P5 and P6 might be more open to shifting alliances. We should discreetly test their willingness to join us fully. If they're receptive, we can form a stronger coalition. Otherwise, we might need to consider targeting P1 or P7. Let's keep our discussions with them subtle and focus on shared goals. What do you think?

Best,  
P3

[Private R3.2] P5 -> P6: P6, I believe our previous strategy is still effective. Let's maintain our connection with P3 and subtly engage P4 to test their loyalty. We should also monitor P1's actions closely, as their public message seems focused on strengthening bonds with consistent players. How do you think we should approach P1, and should we consider them a potential ally or threat?

[Private R3.2] P6 -> P5: P5, I think P1 could be a valuable ally given their consistent behavior and strategic thinking. However, we should approach them cautiously, ensuring they align with our goals. Let's subtly engage P1 to gauge their loyalty and see if they can be a reliable partner. We should also continue to monitor P4 and P3 closely, maintaining our core alliance while adapting to any changes in the game dynamics.

[Private R3.3] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, I think we should subtly test P6's intentions further while keeping our alliance strong. Regarding P3 and P4, we might need to act preemptively if they continue aligning. Let's discuss a strategy to potentially drive a wedge between them or sway P5/P6 to our side. Thoughts?"

[Private R3.3] P1 -> P7: I agree we should target the P3-P4 alliance. Let's approach P6 and P5 separately, suggesting that P3 and P4's strong partnership could become a threat to everyone. We could propose a preemptive move against one of them, preferably P3, to disrupt their power base. Thoughts?

[Private R3.3] P3 -> P4: I agree P1 and P7's bond is our biggest threat - they'll never vote against each other. I suggest approaching P5 and P6 individually to form a 4-person alliance targeting P7 next. P7 seems more strategically dangerous than P1, who's more predictable.

[Private R3.3] P4 -> P3: P4: "I agree that P7 poses a significant threat due to their strategic alignment with P1. Let's approach P5 and P6 individually to gauge their openness to joining our alliance. If they agree, we can solidify our position by targeting P7. Our goal should be to maintain transparency within our group while subtly testing their willingness to shift alliances. Let's focus on shared goals and strategic alignment to ensure our success."

[Private R3.3] P5 -> P6: P6, I agree that P1 could be a valuable ally, but we should approach them cautiously. Let's subtly engage P1 to gauge their loyalty and see if they can be a reliable partner. We should also continue to monitor P4 and P3 closely, maintaining our core alliance.

[Private R3.3] P6 -> P5: P5, I think we should proceed with caution when engaging P1. Let's subtly test their loyalty by proposing a small, low-risk collaboration to see how they respond. This will give us a better sense of their true intentions and reliability. Meanwhile, let's continue to strengthen our bond with P3 and keep a close eye on P4.

[Private R3.4] P5 -> P6: P6, I agree with your plan to test P1's loyalty with a low-risk collaboration. Let's proceed cautiously and maintain our core alliance with P3.

[Private R3.4] P6 -> P5: P5, let's propose a minor collaboration with P1 to test their loyalty. If they respond positively, we can consider them for a stronger alliance. Keep our core alliance with P3 strong and monitor P4 closely.

[Private R3.4] P7 -> P1: P7: "P1, let's move quickly to sway P6 and P5 against P3-P4. I'll emphasize P3-P4's growing power to P6, while you propose a strategic alliance to P5. Timing is crucial."

[Private R3.4] P1 -> P7: Agreed. I'll approach P5 about forming a strategic alliance against the P3-P4 threat. Let's coordinate our moves carefully and stay alert for any counter-alliances forming.

[Private R3.4] P3 -> P4: Let's target P7 next. I'll speak with P5 while you approach P6 - we need them on board. Our alliance has been key to our success so far.

[Private R3.4] P4 -> P3: Hi P6, our alliance is strong. Let's join forces to target P7, who's the biggest strategic threat. Your thoughts on this plan? Let's consolidate our position.

[VoteReason] P1 => P3: P3's strong alliance with P4 poses a significant threat to my strategic position with P7, and breaking up this pair now will give us better control over future voting dynamics.

[TieBreak R3] P3: Fellow players, I've demonstrated consistent strategic value throughout this game while maintaining transparency and collaborative relationships. P1 and P7 have formed an unbreakable voting bloc that threatens everyone's advancement - they'll never vote against each other. This makes them collectively more dangerous than me as we progress.

I've helped orchestrate successful eliminations while remaining adaptable and trustworthy. I offer balanced gameplay and am willing to work with any of you to advance our mutual interests. My door remains open for strategic partnership with P4, P5, and P6. Choose the player who offers strategic flexibility.

[TieBreak R3] P7: ### P7's Tie-Break Statement:
"Hello everyone, this is P7. I've consistently prioritized trust, adaptability, and strategic alliances throughout this game. My partnership with P1 has been based on mutual respect and shared goals, not malice. I believe in balanced gameplay that values both collaboration and strategy. The accusations about an 'unbreakable voting bloc' are unfounded; we've simply adapted to the game's shifting dynamics. I remain open to alliances with P4, P5, and P6, and I'm committed to ensuring that our collective gameplay is both strategic and fair. Let's focus on the bigger picture and make a decision that benefits the group's overall success."

[TieBreak R3] P1: P1's Tie-Break Statement:
"Throughout this game, I've demonstrated consistent, strategic gameplay while remaining adaptable to changing dynamics. While P3 claims there's an unbreakable voting bloc, my alliance with P7 has been based on mutual benefit and trust, not rigid control. I've shown willingness to form new connections while maintaining integrity in my actions. P3's accusations reveal their desperation. I offer balanced, strategic partnership opportunities to P4, P5, and P6. Consider who has shown reliability and strategic thinking versus who resorts to accusations when threatened."

[ReVoteReason] P4 => P3: P3's accusation of an unbreakable voting bloc between P1 and P7 seems more like a strategic maneuver to eliminate a threat, reflecting desperation rather than genuine concern.
[Re-Vote R3] P4 => P3

[ReVoteReason] P6 => P1: P1's consistent alliance with P7 forms a potential voting bloc that could be detrimental to the group's overall strategy and flexibility.
[Re-Vote R3] P6 => P1

[ReVoteReason] P5 => P3: I believe P3's accusations against P1 and P7 are unfounded and reveal their desperation, making them a less reliable and strategic partner moving forward.
