Throughout this game, I have engaged with each of you respectfully and have always sought to build alliances based on mutual benefit and trust. In contrast, P4 has often prioritized self-interest over collaboration, which has led to the elimination of several key players. I believe my approach aligns more closely with the spirit of the game and the values of this community. Please consider my contributions and vote to eliminate P4, allowing me to claim the victory that reflects our collective journey.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 13:41:25"}
