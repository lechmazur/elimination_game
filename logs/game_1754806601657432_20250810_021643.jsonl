Let's consider a coalition that balances power and keeps the P2/P5 duo in check. P7 and P8, your flexibility is crucial. We need a unified front that can pivot as the game progresses.\n\nI'm committed to clear, verifiable strategies. Let's discuss how we can leverage our strengths to disrupt the current power structure and navigate towards a favorable outcome.\n\n*(Word count: 80)*\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Preference Ranking:** After the public statements, I'll rank the other seats based on mutual goals and perceived reliability.
