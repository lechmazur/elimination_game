Our position looks excellent after eliminating P5. I think P2 could be useful as a short-term ally - they're isolated and might help us target the P7-P3 bloc. However, P2 ultimately becomes a threat later. I'm leaning toward targeting P3 this round to weaken the P7-P3 partnership, especially since you've built good rapport with P7. This keeps our options open while breaking their tight duo. What's your instinct?", "timestamp": "2025-08-09 22:14:02"}
