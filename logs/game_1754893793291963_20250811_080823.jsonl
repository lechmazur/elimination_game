I'm focused on continuing to build genuine connections and making informed decisions. I appreciate the emphasis on transparency and reciprocity from several players. In R1, I formed a strong alliance with P2, and I'm open to expanding that to a small, steady core. I'll prioritize players who share their R1 vote and commit to no blindsides.
