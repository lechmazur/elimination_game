I've been strategic without being manipulative, honest without being hurtful. \n\nI've survived by forming real alliances and adapting to changing dynamics. When I made promises, I kept them. When I needed to make difficult decisions, I did so with transparency.\n\nP4 played well, but I believe my balanced approach of social awareness, strategic thinking, and authenticity makes me deserving of your vote. I respected each of you as players and people, and I hope I've earned your respect in return.", "timestamp": "2025-02-26 08:30:20"}
