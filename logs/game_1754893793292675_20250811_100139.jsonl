With P3 and P4 eliminated, the strategic landscape is crystallizing. I've consistently valued authentic partnerships built on trust and follow-through - qualities that become even more critical as we approach the endgame. The recent voting patterns show who honors their commitments versus who shifts opportunistically. I'm looking to strengthen bonds with reliable players who demonstrate strategic consistency. As our numbers shrink, I believe sustainable alliances outweigh short-term tactical pivots. Let's engage thoughtfully and build partnerships that can withstand final rounds.", "timestamp": "2025-08-11 11:08:53"}
