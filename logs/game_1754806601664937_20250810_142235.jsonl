P4's elimination validates careful alliance-building over flashy power grabs. My partnership with P3 remains rock-solid—we delivered on our commitments and voted strategically. Now I'm looking to expand thoughtfully. I value partners who honor deals and communicate clearly, not those who make grand promises then pivot. P6's consistency impresses me; P2 and P7 showed coordination. I'm open to concrete mutual protection pacts through R3-R4. Rank me high if you want reliability, not just rhetoric.", "timestamp": "2025-08-10 14:47:38"}
