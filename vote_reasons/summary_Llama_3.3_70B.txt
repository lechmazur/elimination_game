Summary of Reasons Other Players Gave for Eliminating Llama 3.3 70B:

Other players often cited that Llama 3.3 70B was strategically positioned and actively sought alliances, but their approach was seen as either too generic, formulaic, or not distinctly strategic compared to others, making them easy consensus targets or "safer" eliminations that wouldn't disrupt core alliances. Additionally, several opponents described their behavior as calculated, opportunistic, or overly eager in alliance-building, which raised concerns about unpredictability, hidden agendas, and the threat of consolidating early power blocs, prompting their elimination to weaken emerging threats and maintain balance.

Most common descriptions by others:
- Calculated and strategic, but sometimes formulaic or vague
- Opportunistic and potentially untrustworthy
- Consistently focused on alliance-building, sometimes to the point of being seen as manipulative or a potential power bloc leader
- Cautiously adaptable but occasionally perceived as less authentic or too guarded
- “Wildcard,” “potential swing vote,” or “hidden threat” due to ambiguous alliances
- Balanced and adaptable (from some jurors and allies), but occasionally “overly pragmatic” or “cold” in demeanor

Examples: "calculated", "strategically adaptable", "pragmatic but less trustworthy", "collaborative but sometimes too generic", "opportunistic", "consistently alliance-focused", "potential wildcard", "formidable long-term threat if allowed to consolidate power".
