Jury Elimination Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

The jury eliminated o3’s seat in the final scenario because, despite o3’s claims of transparency and loyalty, jurors consistently cited their ruthless tactics, shifting alliances, and prioritization of eliminations over genuine relationships, which undermined trust and the integrity of the game. Several jurors specifically pointed out that o3’s self-portrayal as consistently honest and communicative was contradicted by their direct involvement in blindsides and strategic betrayals, making them a less deserving winner.
