Jury Elimination Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

The jury eliminated this seat because, despite claims of transparency, P1 was seen as ruthless and inconsistent, having voted against jury members without warning and prioritizing elimination over merit, which some jurors felt undermined trust and the integrity of the game. While some appreciated P1's open communication and strategic alliances, others viewed their tactics as opportunistic and less principled than their opponent's consistent and respectful gameplay.
