Jury Elimination Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

**Summary of the jury's reasoning for eliminating o3 (medium reasoning) in the final scenario:**

The jury eliminated o3 because, despite their claims of transparency, their gameplay was perceived as ruthless and manipulative, prioritizing eliminations and strategic blindsides over genuine alliances and integrity. Jurors cited o3's pattern of breaking loyalty pledges, orchestrating blindsides without warning, and undermining trust, which led them to prefer finalists who demonstrated more consistent honesty, accountability, and respect for the spirit of the game.
