In the final scenario, the jury eliminated o3's seat due to concerns over inconsistent decision-making and a lack of trust stemming from past indecision, which undermined confidence in o3's reliability as a competitor. Compared to the finalist, the jury found the other player's gameplay more transparent and trustworthy, making them the more deserving candidate for the win.
