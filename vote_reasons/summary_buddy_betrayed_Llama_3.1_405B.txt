Buddy Betrayed Summary for Llama 3.1 405B:

Players who betrayed this seat did so mainly because they perceived the player as either forming strong or unpredictable alliances that could threaten their own strategic positioning, or because the player was seen as too adaptable, subtle, or calculatingâ€”potentially making them a long-term threat to game stability and alliance balance. Additionally, some players cited concerns about opportunism, shifting loyalties, lack of commitment to existing partnerships, or the player's moves being too agreeable and less strategically distinctive compared to others.
