From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P2's initial public message was the shortest among active players, aligning with the early-round consensus to target the least communicative. While all tied seats claim engagement, P2's brevity in self-introduction and perceived vulnerability in initial strategy discussions justify elimination.
From DeepSeek R1 => Targeting P7 disrupts a quieter alliance (P4-P7) while minimizing attention on us, aligning with strategic coordination to eliminate under-the-radar threats.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7 seems to be forming a quieter alliance with P4, and eliminating them now is strategically beneficial while drawing less attention than targeting more visible pairs.
