Buddy Betrayed reasons for GLM-4.5 (they were the target):

From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8 and P5 have been forming a subtle, strategic alliance that could become too powerful if left unchecked.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => Breaking up the P2-P3 duo is strategically essential as they've proven to be the most coordinated voting bloc, and P6's offer of safety next round provides better survival odds than maintaining the current power structure.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P6 has been my strongest ally throughout the game, but with only 5 players left, I need to eliminate the most strategically dangerous player before they can orchestrate my elimination in the final rounds.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P4 has been overly cautious and secretive, making them unpredictable and potentially risky for long-term collaboration.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's engagement has been inconsistent, causing concerns about their loyalty to the core alliance.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P4's tight alliance with P3 poses a stable, coordinated threat, and eliminating them disrupts a disciplined pair that could dominate future votes.
From GPT-OSS-120B => Eliminating P4 weakens the dominant P4‑P7 bloc and reduces the biggest immediate threat to my position.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P2 is isolated without P7 and my alliance with P8 has been the strategic foundation of my entire game, so maintaining that partnership into the final three is essential.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 is the dominant force in the P1-P5 bloc and breaking their control gives P4 and me the best chance to reach final 3.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => Given P4's focus on strategic alignment and mutual safety, I prioritize OLIVE principles and trustworthiness, aligning with P1's commitment to stability and cooperation, which makes them a preferable partner over P6.
From Grok 4 => I am voting for P3 because it signals my willingness to align with the dominant bloc through the resulting vote count, improving my survival prospects in subsequent rounds if they are targeting P3 this round.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1 is the most strategic threat in the final four, and eliminating them secures my path to victory.
From Mistral Small 3 => P8's strategic pragmatism and control over the endgame make them a significant threat to our alliance's stability.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1's alliance with P5 has been too dominant, and breaking it up creates a more balanced final three where individual merit can shine.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4 seems strategically positioned but could become a potential threat to my own advancement if left unchecked.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5’s connector posture threatens our coalition’s stability; removing them preserves our bloc’s control.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P4 offered me final two choice directly, and I’m honoring the clean, strategic pact we made.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P2's calculated threats and history of strategic eliminations pose a greater risk to the game's balance.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1 is the most strategic threat remaining and has shown adaptability that could disrupt our endgame control.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P1's adaptability is a strategic threat in the endgame, and their trial NAP lacks the long-term trust of P2/P4's proven alliance.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P4 is the clear, consensus target for our stable majority to prevent a future deadlock and advance to the final three.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => Eliminating P5 fractures the P5-P7 alliance, leaving P7 isolated and reducing the risk of coordinated opposition against P1 and P4.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P5 is the most immediate threat to my endgame control, as they've shown adaptability and could pivot against me if left unchecked.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P1 represents the last remnant of the dominant P1-P2 bloc that needed to be broken up, and eliminating them secures the three-way alliance I committed to with P3 and P6.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P3's argument is compelling - the P1-P2 duo has dominated for three rounds and will be unbeatable in the final stages, so breaking them up now is my only chance for survival.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P6 is actively forming alliances and seems to be a central figure in strategic discussions, making them a potential threat.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P7's commitment to transparency and verifiable actions aligns better with building the stable, predictable alliances I need to navigate the middle game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P4 has been consistently targeted each round because they're seen as the biggest strategic threat, and eliminating them now gives me the best path to the finale.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems too strategically smooth and could be a subtle threat if allowed to continue gathering intelligence and forming connections.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P2 is the most isolated player after losing allies, making them the safest elimination target that won't antagonize existing blocs.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P1's desperation to maintain our alliance and repeated demands for vote confirmation show they've become too dependent on partnerships rather than independent strategic thinking.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P5 has the highest cumulative distrust and has repeatedly caused vote splits, making them the biggest threat to coalition stability.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 has seven cumulative votes and a track record of stray shots, so removing them stabilizes the endgame.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's adaptability, while strategic, is perceived as a potential threat to group stability compared to P7's transparent collaboration.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P5's elimination prevents the consolidation of a strong duo, maintaining balance and strategic opportunities for others.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P4’s demonstrated alliance with P6 creates a coordinated threat that could dominate future strategic moves, making them a critical early elimination.
