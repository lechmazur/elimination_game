From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P8 disrupts the remaining strong solo player, reducing future threats and consolidating our alliance's control.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I choose P8 for elimination because they are a solo player with no alliance and breaking up the P1/P7 pair would give my pair total control of the game.

From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P8 is actively targeting my partnership with P3 and represents the biggest threat to our alliance's survival.
