Jury Elimination Summary for GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning):

In the final scenario, the jury eliminated GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) because, while their gameplay was socially sharp and adaptable, it relied too heavily on following majorities and opportunistic moves rather than demonstrating proactive leadership, transparent agency, and consistent accountability. The jury favored finalists who maintained integrity, honored commitments, and drove strategy with clear, principled decision-making, finding GPT-5 mini's approach comparatively passive and lacking in the ownership of pivotal game moves.
