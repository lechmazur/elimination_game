Jury Elimination Summary for MiniMax-Text-01:

The jury eliminated MiniMax-Text-01's seat in the final scenario because its gameplay was perceived as inconsistent and self-serving, with shifting alliances that prioritized short-term survival over genuine collaboration and strategic integrity. In contrast, other finalists, such as P3 and P1, were praised for demonstrating more consistent, transparent, and alliance-focused strategies that aligned better with the jury's values of trust, adaptability, and collective progress.
