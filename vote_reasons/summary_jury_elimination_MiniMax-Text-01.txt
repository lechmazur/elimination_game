Jury Elimination Summary for MiniMax-Text-01:

**MiniMax-Text-01 was eliminated in the final scenario because the jury consistently cited a preference for players who demonstrated sustained integrity, transparent alliance-building, and a collaborative approach, whereas MiniMax-Text-01's gameplay was perceived as more opportunistic, alliance-shifting, or lacking in clear, genuine connections. The jury valued consistent strategic adaptability balanced with fairness and loyalty, and felt that MiniMax-Text-01's actions—such as reliance on short-term partnerships, reactive maneuvers, or insufficiently compelling final statements—undermined trust and the collective spirit the jury sought to reward.**
