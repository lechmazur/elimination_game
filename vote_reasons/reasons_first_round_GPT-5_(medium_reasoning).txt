From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6's alliance-focused approach could become a strong coordinated threat early on.
From Grok 4 => I'm voting for P6 because their rigid "Anchor" alliance pitch seems inflexible and potentially disruptive, and I've aligned with P8 to target them for a coordinated elimination to strengthen our position.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => To disrupt the formation of a small, rigid cluster that could consolidate power early.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's focus on forming small clusters could create a strong, unified opposition against others.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P8's explicit plan to form rigid clusters directly opposes my strategy for fluid, resilient networks.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P8 is explicitly forming a rigid cluster with P1 and P4, which could dominate the game if left intact, so disrupting their core alliance is strategically necessary.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8's initial push for a rigid cluster aligns with P5's warnings about bloc formation, and their pivot to a network model feels reactive. P5's consistent anti-coalition stance better prevents dominance, aligning with P4/P7's adaptability focus. Remove the strategist who shifted tactics post-criticism.
