Buddy Betray reasons by GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning):

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5's reserved NAP slots centralize power at a critical F4 and threaten to control the endgame.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7’s rigid, less-flexible approach makes them my least-preferred core partner, so I’ll target them.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7 privately listed our core (P8, with P2 as backup) as targets and feels least trustworthy despite committing to protocol, so I'm removing them.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I promised P8 I would honor our pact and won’t break that commitment.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I’m eliminating P3 to preserve the pre-declared P2–P4–P7 trio and maintain the stability/consistency we need to reach F3.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => You broke our no-surprise pact by voting P2 in Round 5 after agreeing to vote with me, so I can't trust you.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Voting P4 to preserve my established P2/P6 core and because P4 is the most isolated, unreliable option.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 is the strongest public threat with the most jury appeal, so removing them improves my endgame chances.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 joined late and is the least-proven partner compared to my locked trio with P6 and P5.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Locked with P1 and P2; voting P4 maintains our unified, low‑drama trio and avoids a split.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I’m voting out P8 because I honor my consistent partnership with P5 and find P8 less reliably aligned with me for the Final Two.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => You attempted to flip and I’m committed to my alliance with P1 (and previously P4), so I’ll vote you to keep our coordination intact.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Joined our shield late and previously suggested targeting P4/P5, so I don't fully trust their commitment.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 is the biggest immediate threat to forming a stable, low-profile final three.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 is an outsider who previously voted against me and threatens the continuity of our trusted trio.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 refused my offer to take me to F2 and is locked with P8, so I don't trust him as a final-two partner.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7 is actively pushing to flip and destabilize our working majority, so I'm voting to preserve stability.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I vote P1 to preserve our existing low‑drama core with P3 and P4—P1 is a recent, unproven addition whose rising support risks destabilizing the bloc.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 lied about others' confirmations and pressured me without proof, so I can't trust them.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Voting P3 because our pact agreed on P3 as the logical fallback and they appear the most vulnerable/least committed.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 repeatedly tried to poach me and undermine our public P1–P5–P2 pledge, so he's the untrusted threat to our agreed trio.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 is actively trying to flip alliances and threatens our agreed F3 plan, so I'm voting to remove them.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I have silent locks with P1 and P4, so I'm voting out P5 as the only non-locked target.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8's open, flexible play has made them an unpredictable wildcard; I prefer to preserve the more consistent core players.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5 questioned my intentions and risked fracturing our bloc, so I don't trust them to stay aligned.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5 questioned my loyalty and hinted at targeting me, making them a potential liability to the core.
