Buddy Betray reasons by Llama 3.1 405B:

From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting for P5 because their partnership with P4 risks centralizing influence, and I believe eliminating them will promote strategic diversity and mitigate concentrated threats.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P1 because they seem to be forming strong alliances with multiple players, which could become a threat to my own position in the game.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I believe P5's history of forming dominant alliances poses a significant risk to the balance of the game, and eliminating them would ensure a fairer final showdown.
