Buddy Betrayed reasons for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 (they were the target):

From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P3 publicly exposed our alliance's internal conflict and refuses to accept any explanation, making them an unpredictable liability who will likely target me regardless.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => While P5's strategy of targeting perceived pairs is valid, their approach seems more disruptive to early-game stability, and I believe maintaining cohesion with reliable communicators like P8 will lead to more productive alliances in the coming rounds.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P8 has been consistently targeting P4 (my strongest ally) and is working with P1 to disrupt our majority alliance.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) => P5's strong and vocal leadership in the P4-P5-P6 alliance directly threatens my survival by maintaining their bloc's dominance.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => Your broken trust and actions have made our alliance unsustainable.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => While P3 has been my strategic partner, P5's consistent loyalty and integrity represent the values that have guided our alliance to success, and I believe maintaining this principled approach gives me the best path forward.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => Eliminating P4 disrupts their strategic alliance with P2 and maintains the balance of power with P1 and P7.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P6's consistent targeting and alliance with P8 pose a significant strategic threat to the remaining players.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3's strong commitment to their current alliance makes them the biggest threat to my survival.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => (no reason)
From Mistral Small 3 => P5 is a wildcard with unpredictable behavior, which poses a greater risk to long-term stability than keeping the established P4-P8 alliance.
From Mistral Large 2 => P8's elimination will disrupt the dominant alliance and restore balance to the game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => Despite the strategic logic of their final three argument, I must honor my commitment to P5 who trusted our alliance.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P7's public statement about exposing hidden blocs and promoting transparent collaboration seems more aligned with maintaining an open, fair game dynamic compared to P6's more rigid and potentially exclusionary approach.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7 was quick to assume I was using the server errors as a strategy and seemed ready to vote me out immediately, showing less patience than others might have.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P2 to break the P3/P8 alliance and advance my game.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P8 is isolated and pushing for a risky tie, while P2 and P7 have a stronger, more stable alliance.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P1 appears to be a strategic threat who's actively forming alliances to target others (like their plan with P6 against P4), and I need to eliminate strong strategic players early.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Eliminating P1 dismantles a rigid bloc that fuels stalemates, enabling flexible coalitions essential for collective survival.
