Jury Elimination Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

In the final scenario, the jury chose to eliminate Microsoft Phi-4 largely due to its inconsistent and sometimes chaotic approach, including frequent alliance shifts and moments of self-sabotage or disconnected, template-like final statements that did not reflect genuine engagement. Jurors consistently favored finalists who demonstrated sustained integrity, strategic adaptability, and authentic relationship-building over Phi-4â€™s perceived unpredictability, lack of personal accountability, and strategies that sometimes prioritized short-term self-interest over long-term collaborative trust.
