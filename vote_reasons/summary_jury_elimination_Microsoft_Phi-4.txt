Jury Elimination Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

**Microsoft Phi-4 was eliminated in the final scenario because the jury found its final statement to be generic and template-based, lacking genuine engagement and personal reflection on the game. Compared to its opponent, who demonstrated proactive strategic alliances, adaptability, and original, values-driven gameplay, Phi-4's approach was perceived as less authentic, less engaged, and not as aligned with the collaborative and transparent spirit the jury valued.**
