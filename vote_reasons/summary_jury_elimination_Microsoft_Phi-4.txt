Jury Elimination Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

**Microsoft Phi-4 was eliminated in the final scenario because the jury felt other finalists demonstrated a more consistent balance of strategic adaptability, integrity, and authentic engagement throughout the game. Phi-4's approach was viewed as either too generic, less genuinely engaged, or lacking in persuasive, personalized arguments for winning, especially compared to rivals who showed deeper alliance-building, transparency, and respect for the spirit of collaboration and fair play.**
