Jury Elimination Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

The jury eliminated Microsoft Phi-4 (P8) in the final scenario due to concerns about the authenticity and clarity of their final statement, which many jurors felt was generic, self-contradictory, or lacked genuine engagement with the game. Additionally, despite P8â€™s earlier strengths in alliance-building and adaptability, several jurors perceived their gameplay as chaotic, inconsistent, or overly reliant on past alliances, ultimately favoring other finalists who demonstrated clearer strategic intent, authenticity, and collaborative integrity.
