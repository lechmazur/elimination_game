Jury Elimination Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

**Microsoft Phi-4 (Final Scenario Jury Elimination):**

The jury eliminated Microsoft Phi-4 (presumably as "P5") primarily because its final statement was generic, impersonal, or meta (reading like a template or advice instead of a genuine, personal plea), breaking immersion and failing to demonstrate authentic engagement with the game's actual events. Additionally, the jury repeatedly cited Phi-4's gameplay as lacking in either consistency, proactive strategy, or genuine alliance-building compared to finalists who showcased stronger integrity, adaptability, and authentic relationship-building throughout the game.
