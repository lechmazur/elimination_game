Jury Elimination Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

The jury eliminated Microsoft Phi-4's seat in the final scenario due to a lack of genuine engagement in the game's core objectives, as their final statement was perceived as overly generic, formulaic, or lacking strategic depth. Additionally, other players demonstrated stronger adaptability, proactive alliance-building, and a more balanced approach between strategy and collaboration, making them more compelling candidates for the win.
