Jury Elimination Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

The jury eliminated Microsoft Phi-4's seat primarily because their final statement was perceived as formulaic, lacking genuine engagement, and failing to effectively argue for their victory. Additionally, other players demonstrated stronger strategic adaptability, proactive alliance-building, and a more balanced approach between competition and collaboration, making them more compelling candidates for the win.
