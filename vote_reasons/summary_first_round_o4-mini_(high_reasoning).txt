Round 1 Summary for o4-mini (high reasoning):

Other players cited o4-mini's (P7) aggressive coalition-building—particularly their push for a large four-person alliance and visible alignment with P2—as a major threat to game balance and alliance stability in Round 1. Multiple opponents also expressed concern that o4-mini's highly strategic, analytical, and adaptable approach made them unpredictable, potentially manipulative, and likely to consolidate power if not eliminated early.
