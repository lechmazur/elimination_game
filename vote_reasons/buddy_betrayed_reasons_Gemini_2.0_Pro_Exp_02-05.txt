Buddy Betrayed reasons for Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 (they were the target):

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7 is actively sowing distrust and targeting alliances, which disrupts strategic collaboration.
From Amazon Nova Pro => Eliminating P8 disrupts the P4/P8 alliance, which has been a dominant force in the game.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P5's elimination would maintain the balance of power and prevent the formation of an inflexible bloc.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P7 seems too strategic and adaptable, potentially forming unpredictable alliances that could disrupt my current positioning.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P4 is the most vulnerable target given P3's elimination and our previous alignment, making it the strategically safest vote.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P2's strategy, while consistent, appears more rigid and less adaptable compared to P6's, who has shown stronger alliance-building and tactical awareness.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting P3 out because I think they might be a stronger opponent in the final round, and I want to increase my chances of winning.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's focus on cautious collaboration may indicate a lack of boldness in strategic moves, which could hinder adaptability in the evolving game dynamics.
From GPT-4o mini => I believe P7's vocal strategy may pose a greater threat to forming alliances compared to P2's focus on collaboration and fairness.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's bluntness and focus on actions over words may create unnecessary tension and hinder collaboration, making them a less favorable ally in this strategic game.
From DeepSeek-V3 => Eliminating P3 disrupts the entrenched P1-P3 alliance, promoting strategic diversity and adaptability in the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5 seems overly focused on observing and not actively contributing to forming beneficial connections early on.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => I believe P8 and I have demonstrated more independent strategic thinking and alignment, which is crucial for this final round.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's explicit mention of our alliance in their tie-break statement creates a strategic liability that could make both of us targets in future rounds.
From GPT-4o Feb 2025 => P3 and P1 have been a strong duo, and eliminating P3 gives me the best chance to reach the final two.

From GPT-4o mini => P6's cautious approach may hinder open collaboration and adaptability, which are crucial in this evolving game environment.
From DeepSeek R1 => P3's strategic alliance with P5 poses a greater long-term threat to the remaining players' survival compared to P7's collaborative approach.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3's openness may be a tactic to gain trust, but their strategic adaptability could be a threat in the final rounds.

From Mistral Large 2 => P2's approach, while adaptable, lacks the clear strategic depth shown by P7 and P8.
