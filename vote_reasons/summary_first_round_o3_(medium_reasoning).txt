Round 1 Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

Other players eliminated o3 in Round 1 primarily due to concerns about their unpredictability and flexible or transactional approach to alliances, which made them seem like a destabilizing "wildcard" or aggressive strategic threat who might disrupt early collaboration and long-term trust. Several also cited o3's emphasis on decisive or concrete action, open negotiation, and willingness to form tight or temporary voting blocs as making them potentially too influential or divisive, threatening both individual strategies and group stability.
