Other players cited o3's analytical and strategic approach—particularly their focus on mapping preferences, forming micro-alliances, and tracking loyalty—as making them a significant early threat to alliance stability and group trust. Several also noted that o3's calculated, sometimes rigid or reciprocal style could quickly become isolating or undermine collaborative dynamics, prompting early elimination to reduce risk and prevent consolidation of power.
