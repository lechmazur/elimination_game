Round 1 Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

In Round 1, other players cited o3’s highly analytical, data-driven, and alliance-focused approach as a primary reason for targeting them, describing their strategies as rigid, overly strategic, and potentially destabilizing to both group trust and alliance flexibility. Many viewed o3’s aggressive push for bloc-building, information-sharing pacts, and calculated moves as threats to adaptable gameplay, with concerns that their influence could quickly consolidate power or undermine emerging coalitions if not addressed early.
