Round 1 Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

Players eliminated "o3" in Round 1 primarily because their emphasis on explicit information-sharing, short-term strategic deals, and transactional alliance-building was seen as too calculating, inflexible, or risky, making others wary of unpredictability and instability. Several players also noted concern that o3â€™s direct approach to forming voting blocs and proposing rigid or aggressive alliance strategies could threaten broader group trust and undermine adaptable, genuine collaboration.
