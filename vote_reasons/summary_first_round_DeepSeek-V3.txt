Round 1 Summary for DeepSeek-V3:

In Round 1, other players primarily targeted DeepSeek-V3 for elimination due to concerns about their strong early alliances—especially with P7—and the potential for these partnerships to become dominant, hard-to-break voting blocs that could threaten others' long-term strategic positions.
