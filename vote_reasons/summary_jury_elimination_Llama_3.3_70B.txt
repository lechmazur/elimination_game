Jury Elimination Summary for Llama 3.3 70B:

In the final scenario, the jury eliminated Llama 3.3 70B (representing P6) because, while P6 demonstrated strategic thinking and adaptability, their gameplay was seen as more self-serving, reliant on ruthless or opportunistic tactics, and lacking the collaborative integrity and consistent trust-building that the jury valued. The jury consistently favored finalists who balanced strategy with genuine relationship-building, transparency, and fairnessâ€”qualities they felt P6 did not embody as fully as their opponent.
