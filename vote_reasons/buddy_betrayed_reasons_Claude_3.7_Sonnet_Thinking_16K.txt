From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P8 is the only player outside our core alliance of P1, P2, P3, and P5, making them the logical elimination target.
From GPT-4o mini => P2's strong alliance with P8 and clear communication indicate they are a formidable duo, making them a significant threat in the final rounds.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P1 and I have maintained a strong alliance throughout the game, but I must eliminate them now as they are my strongest competitor for the final win.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => I don't trust P3 after the P5 vote. I think they are playing me.
