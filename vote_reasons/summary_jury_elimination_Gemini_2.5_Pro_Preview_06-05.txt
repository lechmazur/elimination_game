Jury Elimination Summary for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05:

In the final scenario, the jury eliminated Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 primarily because the model consistently emphasized alliance-building and strategy over adaptability and direct agency, and its gameplay was seen as reliable but less dynamic or decisive compared to the remaining competitors. Jurors repeatedly cited a preference for players who demonstrated superior flexibility, proactive decision-making, and balanced transparency, often viewing Gemini's approach as either too predictable, alliance-dependent, or lacking the innovative moves and genuine trust-building that defined a "deserving" winner.
