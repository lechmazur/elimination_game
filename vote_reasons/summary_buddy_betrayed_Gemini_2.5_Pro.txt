Buddy Betrayed Summary for Gemini 2.5 Pro:

Players who betrayed this seat cited several key reasons: unpredictability or volatility (e.g., being a wildcard, shifting alliances, or exposing alliances), direct threats to their survival or endgame chances (such as strong leadership, dominant alliances, or jury threats), and the need to restore balance or maintain flexibility in the game (by breaking up blocs or removing isolated or unreliable players). Additionally, some referenced loyalty to other alliances, prior commitments, or the necessity to avoid random outcomes like tiebreakers, while a few noted a lack of trust or poor judgment under pressure as decisive factors.
