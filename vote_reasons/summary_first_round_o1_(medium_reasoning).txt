Round 1 Summary for o1 (medium reasoning):

Other players gave several reasons for eliminating o1 in Round 1, most commonly citing that o1’s alliance-building and strategic ambition made them appear as an early threat—either by forming multiple partnerships, taking a leadership role, or signaling an intent to consolidate power.
