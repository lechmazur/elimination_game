From Grok 4 => P8's public statement mentioning a partnership with the already-eliminated P6 indicates confusion or instability, making them an unreliable player to keep in the game.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P8's public instability and vocal nature make them a risk to the group's cohesion.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P8's emphasis on collaboration, integrity, and challenging unfair moves aligns more with the game's values of fairness and strategic teamwork, making them a stronger candidate for the final vote.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P8's final statement was more self-serving and less reflective of the collaborative spirit they claimed to embody, while P6 consistently demonstrated adaptability and strategic integrity.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 repeatedly pivoted and courted multiple sides for advantage, while P6 consistently honored verified commitments and clearer communication.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 consistently honored verification and worked with me in good faith, whereas P8’s shifts (e.g., calling P2 their #1 then voting them) read as opportunistic and less aligned with transparent play.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8 demonstrated consistent collaborative spirit, verifiable commitments, and a focus on fairness, aligning with the game’s emphasis on teamwork and integrity over P6’s more self-serving adaptability.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 made an unsubstantiated claim and failed to provide the requested quote/timestamp when challenged.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 made an unsubstantiated, provably false claim about my lack of falsifiable commitments and failed to provide a quote/timestamp or an R4 won’t‑vote by the deadline.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 made vague accusations and failed to substantiate them when asked, so I'm voting them out.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P6 has made vague accusations without providing concrete evidence, undermining fair gameplay.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => (no reason)
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Your aggressive targeting of me and history of strategic manipulation make you the greatest immediate threat to my survival.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5 publicly betrayed the coalition by targeting P4, proving they're unreliable and a threat to our unity.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5 attempted to betray our strategic partnership by initially targeting me, proving their unreliability and making them a direct threat to coalition stability.
From GLM-4.5 => P5 publicly betrayed our coalition by targeting P4 without coordination, making them an immediate threat to stability.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 publicly led the push to eliminate me and that attack threatens group cohesion, so I'm voting to remove that destabilizing influence.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P6 because, despite their claims of strategic play, their shifting loyalties and perceived manipulation, as highlighted by P1, outweighed their contributions to fair discussions, and P1 demonstrated more consistent alliance-building and integrity throughout the game.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P6 demonstrated consistent strategic integrity and adaptability by prioritizing fair collaboration throughout the game, while P1's shifting targets and late-game opportunism undermined trust and stability.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Locking with our bloc—P7 has shown opportunistic/flip-risk signals.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 publicly labeled me a flip-risk despite receipts proving my consistency, revealing opportunistic misinformation and making them the least trustworthy seat.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => After a courtesy warn P7 offered only a vague defense and showed audit mismatches, making them our coordinated target for inconsistent/opaque play.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 publicly branded me “flip-risk,” has targeted me before, and their opportunistic framing makes them the most immediate threat to my game.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7 publicly pushed to eliminate me without solid receipts, making them a destabilizing threat.
From GLM-4.5 => P7 has accumulated the highest total votes against them historically (5), making them the riskiest ally to retain in the final stages despite current bloc alignment.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => R5 receipts show you privately timestamped me “P3,” publicly warned “P5,” and actually voted P4—a double mismatch and fabrication.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s R5 DM timestamped “P3” contradicts his public claim of voting P5 and the zero-P5 tally, so he’s the last breach of our discipline standard.
From Kimi K2 => P1 is the pivot between two duos and the biggest threat to my long-term survival.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Voting P1 to break the P1–P6 duo before they form an unassailable majority.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P1’s partnership with P6 is too strong and removing P1 now disrupts their emerging majority.
From Grok 4 => P1's opportunistic attempt to betray P6 in Round 4 shows he's unreliable and a threat to dominate if not eliminated now, allowing me to align with P6 and my ally P2 for better endgame positioning.
From Kimi K2 => P1’s own tie-break statement frames his vote for P6 as a deliberate break of their bloc, proving he’s willing to sacrifice a partner for positioning—exactly the self-interested move the jury will distrust and the rest of us should end now.
From Grok 4 => P1's history of opportunistic betrayals, including turning on P6 and higher cumulative votes, makes him the greater threat to a balanced endgame.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 remained unpaired and I have no alliances with them, making them the safest low-retaliation target.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 is the least strategically aligned and the only other unpaired seat, making them the safest low-retaliation elimination.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P5’s collaborative tone lacks the strategic edge demonstrated by others.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5 appears unpaired and P4 and I agreed to target them if unpaired.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I am voting out P8 because they are perceived as a potential destabilizer and a threat to our forming alliance by pushing to target P1.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 is our coordinated target and is pushing against the core, so removing them protects our alliance.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P8 is actively organizing a coalition to eliminate me and poses the most immediate threat to my survival.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P8 is rallying too many allies publicly and poses the biggest threat to our core alliance.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => I am honoring the agreement with the core alliance to eliminate P8 and ensure a decisive, deadlock-free vote.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P8 formed an exclusionary bloc and excluded me, making them a destabilizing threat to our consensus.
From GLM-4.5 => P8's bloc-building and outdated targeting of P6 create instability and deadlock risks, threatening our alliance's control.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P8 has formed a tight bloc with P5 and P1/P3, making them a strategic threat to disrupt for a more balanced game.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P2’s bloc feels more stable and transparent, while P8’s plan relies too heavily on P6’s unpredictability.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5's flexible, data-driven approach creates unpredictable risk early on, and I coordinated with P6 to target them for elimination.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P5 felt overly adaptable and non-committal, which makes me wary of hidden agendas this early on.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 appears tied to P2 and, as a flexible low-commit swing, is the safest low‑backlash Round‑1 cut.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I see P5 as potentially opportunistic with a tone that blends in too smoothly, which could hide deeper strategies.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5 appears flexible and allied with P2, making them the best low-risk early target.
From GLM-4.5 => P5's flexible, data-driven approach feels unpredictable and risky early on, making them a strategic target to reduce instability.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting out P1 because they are forming a strong alliance with P4 and potentially dictating the game's direction.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => Disrupt the dominant P1/P4 bloc to prevent them from controlling the game.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P1 and P4 are too closely aligned and controlling the game's narrative, making P1 a bigger threat than P4.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P1 is actively leading the coordinated bloc with P4 to target and eliminate me and P3 next.
