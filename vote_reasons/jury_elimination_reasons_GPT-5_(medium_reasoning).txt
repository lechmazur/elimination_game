From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2 demonstrated more consistent transparency and proactive accountability throughout the game, taking clear ownership of strategic moves while maintaining a principled approach to alliance-building.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P2's strategy involved manipulation and breaking alliances, while P4 consistently honored pacts and valued integrity throughout the game.
From DeepSeek R1 => P2 demonstrated consistent strategic clarity and accountability, while P4's claims of unwavering loyalty were undermined by their collaboration in eliminating core allies like P8 and P1.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P6's gameplay involved strategic deception, which I find less commendable than P8's authentic and honest approach.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7's gameplay was more strategic and transparent, while P3's approach lacked the same level of accountability and directness.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P7 made a direct promise to protect me in Round 3 and then immediately broke it, so I cannot in good conscience reward that specific betrayal.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => While P7 played consistently, P3 showed more strategic adaptability and was genuinely willing to consider different paths forward when I approached them in the final four, rather than being rigidly locked into predetermined alliances.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P2 demonstrated proactive leadership, consistency, and accountability throughout the game, making them the more deserving finalist.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3's alliance voted with my own in an attempt to break up the opposing bloc during the round I was eliminated, whereas P2 voted against me.

From Grok 4 => P8 played a steadier, more adaptable game with stronger social awareness, building reliable connections without the volatility and shifting loyalties that marked P4's path.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => While P4 played a bold and transparent game, P8's steady approach and ability to navigate to the end without accumulating as many votes (only 3 total vs P4's 6) demonstrates superior strategic positioning and social awareness throughout the game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => As P8, I identified P2 early as the architect of rigid bloc voting that limited strategic flexibility, and they were the dominant strategic force throughout the game.
