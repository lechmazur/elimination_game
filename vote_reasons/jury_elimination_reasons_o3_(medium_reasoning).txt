Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for o3 (medium reasoning):

From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's consistent transparency and open communication throughout the game demonstrated a respect for the process and the other players, making them the more deserving winner.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1's claim of never voting against jurors without warning feels false, as his alliance eliminated the entire jury, often through coordinated moves.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P1 because, despite their claims of transparency, they consistently demonstrated ruthless tactics and prioritized elimination over merit, which I believe undermines the integrity of the game.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P5 broke their loyalty pledge by blindsiding me early, demonstrating the opportunism I cannot reward.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P5’s inconsistent decision-making and past indecision undermined trust, making P1 the more reliable and transparent competitor.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P5's claim about never voting for jury members is false, as they voted to eliminate me.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1's claim of never voting against jury members first is false; I was voted out by P1 in Round 3.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P1's strategic integrity and consistent alliance-building throughout the game demonstrated a more principled approach to gameplay compared to P8's more opportunistic strategy.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Your proactive alliances and consistent strategic integrity shaped the game's direction more meaningfully than P8's adaptive neutrality.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P8 demonstrated consistent respect and strategic thinking, while P1's inconsistency and dismissive behavior suggest a less reliable final two candidate.
From Qwen QwQ-32B 16K => P2's claim of loyalty rings hollow after they voted to eliminate their own ally P5 in Round 6, contradicting their stated commitment to protecting allies "whenever possible."
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P2 targeted jury members like myself (P8) in Round 4 and misrepresented his gameplay as consistently loyal, while P4 demonstrated superior strategic adaptability throughout the game.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P4 demonstrated superior adaptability by successfully navigating the loss of their original partner P1 and forming new strategic partnerships, while P2 relied on a single rigid alliance structure throughout the game.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P3 demonstrated consistent adaptability and strategic integrity, while P4's reliance on majority votes and self-proclaimed loyalty lacked the same depth of personal connection and resilience.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P4 because they demonstrated strong strategic gameplay and transparency throughout, earning their spot in the final two and deserving the win over P3, who was seen as more passive.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P3 demonstrated consistent adaptability and strategic resilience by building genuine alliances and surviving multiple rounds through calculated moves, while P4's claim of transparent loyalty is contradicted by their tie-break vote against P5 in Round 3 and self-serving endgame maneuvering.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4 demonstrated consistent strategic play and transparency throughout the game.
From DeepSeek R1 => P4's claims of loyalty to eliminated alliances like P2/P5 contradict their voting actions, undermining their integrity, whereas P6's proactive strategy, while aggressive, aligned with their stated intentions.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4 demonstrated more consistent strategic integrity throughout the game, forming genuine alliances and maintaining transparent relationships, while P6's gameplay involved more opportunistic pivoting and hiding behind others' strategic work.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4 demonstrated consistent integrity and strategic foresight throughout the game, valuing relationships and playing openly, which aligns more with the qualities of a deserving winner.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P6 demonstrated consistent strategic leadership and earned trust through decisive actions, while P4’s shifting alliances and late-game maneuvering undermined stability. The jury likely values P6’s proactive integrity over P4’s opportunism.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P2 voted for me in the Round 1 tie-break re-vote, directly contributing to my early risk, and their claim about voting history feels inaccurate from my perspective as a jury member.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P2 demonstrated consistent integrity and trustworthiness throughout the game, valuing alliances and transparency over opportunism.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2demonstrated more strategic clarity, consistent alliance-building, and maintained a principled approach throughout the game that respected other players' agency.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P1's strategic gameplay was more visibly active and risky throughout the game, making their claim of earning the seat more compelling.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) => P1's manipulative tactics, like probing for weaknesses and using fear in the tie-break, directly contributed to the elimination of my ally P6 and myself, whereas P2 focused on fair communication and adaptability, aligning more with my valued gameplay style.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P1 because their gameplay, although strategic, was often perceived as controlling and manipulative, whereas P2 demonstrated a more adaptive and communicative approach.
