Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for o3 (medium reasoning):

From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's consistent transparency and open communication throughout the game demonstrated a respect for the process and the other players, making them the more deserving winner.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1's claim of never voting against jurors without warning feels false, as his alliance eliminated the entire jury, often through coordinated moves.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P1 because, despite their claims of transparency, they consistently demonstrated ruthless tactics and prioritized elimination over merit, which I believe undermines the integrity of the game.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P5 broke their loyalty pledge by blindsiding me early, demonstrating the opportunism I cannot reward.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P5’s inconsistent decision-making and past indecision undermined trust, making P1 the more reliable and transparent competitor.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P5's claim about never voting for jury members is false, as they voted to eliminate me.
From Grok 2 12-12 => I respect P3's consistent and transparent gameplay more than P8's reliance on shifting alliances.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => I’m eliminating P8 because P3 played with greater consistency and transparency, while P8 relied on shifting, opaque alliances.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => (no reason)
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8 demonstrated more strategic depth, consistently tracked group consensus, and showed a more transparent approach to navigating complex game dynamics throughout the competition.
From Qwen QwQ-32B 16K => P6 consistently demonstrated transparency and loyalty, while P8's strategic flexibility prioritized personal survival over alliance stability.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P6 demonstrated more consistent loyalty and integrity throughout the game, aligning with my values of trust and honest gameplay.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P8's shifting alliances and strategic maneuvers, while effective, ultimately undermined the trust and consistency valued in the game.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P8 because P6's consistent emphasis on transparency, honesty, and following through on promises aligns more closely with the values of fair and sincere gameplay that the jury should reward.
