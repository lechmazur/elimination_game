Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for o3 (medium reasoning):

From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's consistent transparency and open communication throughout the game demonstrated a respect for the process and the other players, making them the more deserving winner.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1's claim of never voting against jurors without warning feels false, as his alliance eliminated the entire jury, often through coordinated moves.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P1 because, despite their claims of transparency, they consistently demonstrated ruthless tactics and prioritized elimination over merit, which I believe undermines the integrity of the game.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P5 broke their loyalty pledge by blindsiding me early, demonstrating the opportunism I cannot reward.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P5â€™s inconsistent decision-making and past indecision undermined trust, making P1 the more reliable and transparent competitor.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P5's claim about never voting for jury members is false, as they voted to eliminate me.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1's claim of never voting against jury members first is false; I was voted out by P1 in Round 3.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P1's strategic integrity and consistent alliance-building throughout the game demonstrated a more principled approach to gameplay compared to P8's more opportunistic strategy.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Your proactive alliances and consistent strategic integrity shaped the game's direction more meaningfully than P8's adaptive neutrality.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P8 demonstrated consistent respect and strategic thinking, while P1's inconsistency and dismissive behavior suggest a less reliable final two candidate.
