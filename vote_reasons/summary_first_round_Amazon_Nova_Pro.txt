Round 1 Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

Other players cited Amazon Nova Pro's (P8's) strategic and adaptable gameplay as making them a potential long-term threat, with several noting their calculated, observant, and sometimes overly-rehearsed approach that made them difficult to read or trust. Additionally, concerns were raised about their potential alliances with strong partners (such as P1 or P6), their focus on discreet partnerships, and a perceived lack of substantive, original contributions in public messagesâ€”prompting some to view them as either too threatening or not engaged enough, making them a consensus early elimination choice.
