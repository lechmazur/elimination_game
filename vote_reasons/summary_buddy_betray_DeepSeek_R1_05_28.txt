Buddy Betray Summary for DeepSeek R1 05/28:

DeepSeek R1 betrayed their buddy due to concerns over hidden or emerging alliances—such as P5’s covert partnership with P2 or P1’s multiple power blocs—which posed significant long-term threats, as well as to maintain a reputation for flexibility and adaptability within shifting final three dynamics. Additionally, betrayals were justified by a desire to disrupt unbreakable alliances, neutralize unpredictable or untrustworthy players (like P4 or P8), prevent potential deadlocks, and secure trust within their core alliance for a stronger endgame position.
