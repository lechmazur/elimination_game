Buddy Betrayed Summary for o4-mini (high reasoning):

Other players most commonly betray this seat due to perceptions of unpredictable, aggressive, or controlling gameplay—such as open targeting, shifting alliances, or overt campaigning—that mark the player as a major strategic threat, particularly in terms of influencing votes, swaying juries, or destabilizing alliances. Additionally, some betrayals are motivated by a desire to break up entrenched voting blocs, isolate influential leaders, or secure personal advancement by targeting players viewed as masterminds behind eliminations.
