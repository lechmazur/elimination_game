Buddy Betrayed Summary for o4-mini (high reasoning):

Other players cited betrayal of this seat due to patterns of aggressive gameplay—such as overt power plays, unpredictable targeting, and manipulative coalition-building—which made these players appear untrustworthy or threatening to the stability of alliances. Additionally, repeated behaviors like unreliable coordination, accumulation of distrust through multiple votes against them, and attempts to control or sway both public and private votes contributed to perceptions that these players were strategic risks who could endanger others' chances in the endgame.
