Summary for Mistral Large 2:

### Summary of Reasons for Eliminating Mistral Large 2 (across all seats):

Other players most often cited that Mistral Large 2 was building strong, sometimes stealthy, alliances—particularly with one or more other players—which created a potential voting bloc and thus posed a major strategic threat to the rest of the group. Additionally, several eliminators described this player as being consistently strategic, adaptable, and influential in decision-making, making them either a future jury threat if allowed to reach the endgame, or a destabilizing force that could easily tip alliance balance and disrupt existing plans.

### Most Common Descriptions by Other Players:
- **Strategically adaptable**
- **Strong alliance-builder** / **Connector**
- **Balanced and collaborative**, but sometimes viewed as hiding a strategic edge
- **Potential wildcard**: sometimes described as unpredictable due to adaptability and ability to work multiple sides
- **Consistent and reliable** (when aligned), but also seen as **a steady strategic threat**
- **Ruthlessly pragmatic** and capable of **calculated moves**
- Occasionally described as **too openly strategic** or, inversely, **subtly manipulative**

These patterns made Mistral Large 2 a frequent target as both an attractive consensus elimination—due to perceived threat level—and as a player others preferred not to face in the finals.
