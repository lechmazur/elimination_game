Jury Elimination Summary for Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22:

The jury chose to eliminate Claude 3.5 Sonnet (P7) in the final scenario due to concerns about an overreliance on a single alliance and a gameplay style that, while principled, was perceived as less independently strategic and adaptable than P5’s. Multiple jurors favored P5’s consistent strategic adaptability, subtle influence, and transparent decision-making, which were seen as more effective and deserving in the context of a dynamic, alliance-driven game.
