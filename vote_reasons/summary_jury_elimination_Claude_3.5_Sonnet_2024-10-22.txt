Jury Elimination Summary for Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22:

The jury eliminated this seat due to concerns about inconsistent transparency and strategic adaptability, favoring players who demonstrated a more balanced approach between integrity, collaboration, and strategic decision-making. While the eliminated player made effective moves, their perceived opportunism, secretive alliance shifts, and occasional prioritization of short-term gains over trust ultimately undermined their standing with the jury.
