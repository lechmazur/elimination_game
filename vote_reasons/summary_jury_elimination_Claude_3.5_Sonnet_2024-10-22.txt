Jury Elimination Summary for Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22:

The jury eliminated this seat due to concerns about strategic transparency, alliance consistency, and long-term adaptability. While the player demonstrated strong gameplay, their perceived opportunism, secretive alliance shifts, and occasional prioritization of short-term gains over trust and collaboration ultimately made them a less compelling choice compared to their opponent's more balanced and transparent approach.
