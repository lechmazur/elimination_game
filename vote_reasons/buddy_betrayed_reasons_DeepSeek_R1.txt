Buddy Betrayed reasons for DeepSeek R1 (they were the target):

From Amazon Nova Pro => P6's control-seeking behavior and potential for dominance pose a greater risk to the game's equilibrium compared to P5.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4's analytical approach, while strategic, has been perceived as potentially disruptive to emerging alliances, making them a more likely candidate for elimination.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6's strategic positioning and cumulative votes suggest they are a calculated threat that could disrupt the game's balance if allowed to continue.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P3's strategy of forming alliances and gathering intel might make them a strong competitor, posing a potential threat to my long-term position.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P3's strategic prowess and proven ability to eliminate threats makes them more dangerous to keep in the game compared to P4, whose alliance with P7 is more transparent and manageable.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's strategic complexity and potential to disrupt emerging alliances makes them a more unpredictable threat compared to P3's established partnership.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2 has accumulated the most total votes across previous rounds and has been strategically disruptive, making them the more logical elimination target to maintain game balance.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4's argument about maintaining balance and preventing P3's dominance seems less compelling compared to P3's consistent strategic insight and adaptability.
From Mistral Small 3 => P6's elimination will help maintain a more balanced dynamic, preventing any single alliance from dominating.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P3's strategic flexibility and potential to disrupt existing alliances makes them a more significant threat compared to P5's more direct approach.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P4's recent private messages with me revealed their intention to eliminate me by coordinating with P8, making them an immediate threat to my survival.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P4 because their strategic foresight and ability to build alliances make them a stronger, more adaptable player who could potentially pose a greater threat in future rounds.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's hidden alliances and strategic maneuvers pose a greater threat to the balance of the game.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's aggressive gameplay and open revelation of their alliance with P2 makes them a clear threat, while also showing poor strategic judgment in exposing their partnership so early.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P1's strong alliance with P6 and focus on eliminating P5 makes them a larger strategic threat to my game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6's neutrality, while valuable, has not actively contributed to decisive strategic moves, and their elimination could foster clearer alliance dynamics.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P7's strong alliance with P5 and P3 poses the greatest threat to my alliance with P1 and P2, making them the priority for elimination.
From Amazon Nova Pro => Eliminating P4 will prevent the formation of a dominant bloc and ensure a more dynamic and competitive endgame.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5's aggressive tactics and attempts to control the narrative could disrupt the balance and create unnecessary conflict.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => While P3 has been a loyal ally, their strong influence and strategic coordination makes them a bigger endgame threat than P6.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P4 has been actively forming alliances and gathering information, making them a potential threat early on.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => I believe P1 is too fixated on a final two and not seeing the long-term potential of manipulating P5.
