Reasons for eliminating o4-mini (high reasoning) in Round 1:

From GPT-4o mini => P7's focus on observation over collaboration makes me concerned about their commitment to forming genuine partnerships in this game.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P7's focus on observing actions over words makes them a potential strategic threat in later rounds.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P7 because they seem to be more focused on observing and adapting rather than actively building connections and collaborations, which could make them a less reliable ally in the long run.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P6 comes across as highly strategic and potentially threatening, especially if working with P8, making them a prime target for early elimination.

From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P6 because their strategic nature, combined with a potential alliance with P8, poses a significant threat to our early game stability.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P4's calculating and strategic approach, combined with my private discussions with P3 identifying them as a potential threat, makes them the most logical target for elimination.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Their public statement suggested a calculating and potentially untrustworthy approach.

From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P5's overt strategic approach and potential liability to alliance stability make them the optimal elimination target.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5’s overtly strategic posture makes them an early high‑threat without personal rapport to offset it.

From Qwen QwQ-32B 16K => P8's focus on voting records and alignment with P1 in private chats poses a strategic threat to our core alliance.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's focus on "behaviors and voting records" suggests a potentially manipulative strategy that could be risky for our alliance.
