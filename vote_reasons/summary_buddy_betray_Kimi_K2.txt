Buddy Betray Summary for Kimi K2:

Kimi K2 explained their betrayals as calculated moves to fracture dominant blocs and eliminate players who posed the greatest long-term threat to their own win, whether through strategic influence, alliance-building, or jury appeal. Each decision was justified by weighing loyalty, reliability, and the potential to destabilize the game in Kimiâ€™s favor, prioritizing flexibility and a clear path to the final two.
