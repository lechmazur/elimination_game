Reasons for eliminating GPT-OSS-120B in Round 1:

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7 and P8 seem to be forming a strong alliance early on, and breaking it up could create opportunities for others.
From GLM-4.5 => P7's public message lacked strategic depth, focusing more on general positivity, making them appear less of a threat and easier to eliminate without strong backlash.
From DeepSeek R1 => Targeting P2 aligns with disrupting their potential duo with P6 and executing the coordinated strategy with P5.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P2 has strong social pull and a firm P6 pairing, making them the most insulated early coordination threat.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 appears coordinated with P6 and is our agreed primary target to protect the small pact I’m building with P1.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Our alliance with P8 identified P2 as the optimal strategic vote to maintain our safety and reduce social threats.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P2 has formed a strong alliance with P6, making them a potential threat early on.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => (no reason)
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P7's emphasis on adaptability and observant nature makes them a higher strategic risk for our alliance compared to others.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => P7's aggressive and unpredictable behavior threatens stable alliances, aligning with my strategy to eliminate them for mutual protection with P8 and potential trio with P2.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => To maintain consistency with our alliance's strategy and eliminate a player involved in a covert bloc with P6, which threatens transparent cooperation.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6's inconsistency and potential for shifting alliances makes them a strategic threat.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P6's emphasis on adaptability felt vague and potentially slippery, which could destabilize early coordination.
From GLM-4.5 => P6's stated adaptability and willingness to shift alliances when dynamics change could be disruptive to group harmony and make them an unpredictable threat as the game progresses.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 emphasized shifting with dynamics, which feels hedgy/chaotic versus the clear, stable commitments I value.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P4 gave me no private outreach or clear alliance, leaving them an unconnected wildcard I’d rather remove early.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P4 formed a tight pair with P1 that we couldn’t coordinate with, so eliminating P4 reduces paired voting power and stabilizes the field.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => I’m voting for P4 as agreed in my alliance with P3 and P6 to coordinate our Round 1 elimination.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4 formed a locked partnership with P1 that we couldn't coordinate with, making them a threat to our planned voting bloc stability.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 proved loyal to our agreed trio, while P4 actively targeted that alliance, so eliminating P4 preserves trust and continuity.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Eliminating P4 breaks the P1–P4 locked pair and preserves a path to a stable bloc with P7/P3 and P8, consistent with my Round 1 plan.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4's alliances and commitments seem less transparent and more vague compared to P7, who has demonstrated clear and consistent loyalty with P3 and P6.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4's alliance with P1 makes them a stronger threat moving forward, while P7's established coalition with P3 and P6 creates more predictable dynamics that I can work with in future rounds.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P1's emphasis on fairness and alliances seems too open, potentially making them a target for others.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1's public statement was too generic and didn't stand out strategically compared to others.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P8 was identified with my ally as a low-risk, less connected target to solidify our strategic partnership.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted P8 out because they seemed less connected and formed a relatively safe target for our first-round elimination.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8 seems too broadly diplomatic and might form too many connections, making them a strategic threat early in the game.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => I am prioritizing active collaborators and perceived low engagement makes P4 the least strategically valuable alliance partner at this stage.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P4 has been less engaged in both public and private conversations, making them a low-engagement target.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Eliminating P4 aligns with our alliance's strategy to target low-engagement players and preserves P8's stability pact, which directly benefits our position.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P4's focus on eliminating others might increase unpredictability, and their removal could lead to a more balanced dynamic.
From Grok 4 => I'm voting P7 because their broad outreach seems scattershot and unanchored, making them a low-threat consensus pick that aligns with my pact with P8 without targeting stronger emerging blocs.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7's broad outreach and weak anchoring make them the safest consensus elimination that preserves early stability.
From GPT-4o mini => P7's vague stance and lack of clear commitment raise concerns about their reliability in forming alliances.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Eliminating P7 breaks up the P7–P8 duo early, lowers coordination risk, and keeps an open line with P8.
From GLM-4.5 => Eliminating P7 breaks the active P7–P8 voting bloc, reduces unpredictability, and aligns with our core alliance's strategy to prioritize stability and reliable partners like P1/P6.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Breaking the P7–P8 duo reduces volatility and protects the planned P1-P2-P4-P5 stability bloc.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P8's flexible, information-gathering strategy makes them a potential threat.
From Grok 4 => I'm voting P8 because their hesitancy to commit early feels like a potential sign of deception, and it aligns with my alliance agreement with P3 to target them first.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => While P8's caution offers balance, P7's proactive alliance-building with P4 creates a stronger strategic foundation for navigating future eliminations. Removing P8 preserves P4/P7's coordinated advantage while avoiding stagnation risks P7 highlighted.
From Grok 4 => P8's cautious hesitancy raises concerns of potential deception and stagnation, whereas P7 demonstrates proactive alignment and strategic reliability.

From DeepSeek R1 => P4's accusation of a non-existent P2-P6 bloc creates unwarranted suspicion, and eliminating them neutralizes their efforts to destabilize strategic alliances.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P8 feels overly polished and safe, which makes me think they might be positioning subtly for long-term control without showing real strategic intent early on.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8 has been less active in forming strategic alliances compared to others.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 comes off polished and potentially positioning as a safe, strong player, so I’m cutting them early.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P4 seems guarded and less aligned with my alliance strategy.
From DeepSeek R1 => Prior agreement with P6 to target P4 as a perceived less-connected player.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P4 has been guarded and seems like an early threat to our alliance, so eliminating them protects our position.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8 seems the least strategically distinctive and most likely to be easily manipulated in early rounds.
From Mistral Large 2 => P8's subtle but potentially strategic gameplay poses a long-term threat, and early elimination reduces their ability to influence future dynamics.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8's subtle observational strategy could mask a high sleeper threat, making early elimination prudent.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7 seems guarded and I don't trust them to be a reliable early ally.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 is the least connected to my emerging strategic bloc, so removing them should consolidate control for the allies I trust.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Targeting P7 aligns with the bloc's strategy to eliminate the most neutral and least-connected player early.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => Their focus on "uncovering hidden motives" created an atmosphere of distrust, and they seemed least connected to others based on our conversations.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => Their emphasis on "uncovering hidden motives" suggests a manipulative approach that could be dangerous later, and P4 shares my concerns.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => P8's probing style might create distrust among others, making them a potential early threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P8's stated intent to "uncover hidden motives" suggests a less straightforward approach that I find concerning.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P6's approach seems too reliant on observation and opportunism, which could lead to unpredictable alliances.
From Grok 4 => P6's adaptability and potential unpredictability make them a strategic early target, and I've committed to voting them out in alliance with P7 for mutual protection.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6's approach of "bold moves" and "pivoting" seems risky for early alliances, making them a potential liability.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems the most strategically unpredictable and potentially threatening early elimination target based on our private conversations.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's strong focus on alliances may make them a strategic threat in future rounds.
From GLM-4.5 => P1 is forming a strong early alliance with P5, making them a strategic threat to our counterbalance plan.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P7 and I agreed to target P1 to weaken the P1-P5 pairing, which appears to be a strong early alliance that could dominate the game.
From Kimi K2 => P8’s polished neutrality feels like a shield for opportunism, making them the clearest early threat to stable alliances.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => He failed to form any private connections, making him an isolated player and a logical first target for the established pairs.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8's polished "balanced" rhetoric may mask opportunism; perceived as the most strategic early threat to our alliance's stability.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P7 seems to have formed a strong connection with P8, making them a potential alliance to watch.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P7's broad alliance approach makes them unpredictable and a potential early threat to stability.
From Kimi K2 => P7 is the consensus target among the emerging blocs and has no shield, making the vote clean and low-risk.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7 appears unshielded and our alliance has been quietly steering the first vote toward them.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P7 because their openness to broad alliances may lead to unpredictability and potential threat to our strategic alignment.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I'm voting P1 because P4 and I agreed to target them this round to secure our pairing and remove a perceived strategic threat.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P1 is a strong strategic threat with a clear alliance and data-driven approach, making them a high-risk player to keep in the game.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P1 because they have formed a strong alliance with P5 and have a data-driven approach that could make them a dominant force if not checked early.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 publicly emphasized willingness to pivot for a better deal, signaling lower reliability than others this round.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5's public inconsistency and admitted willingness to pivot on alliances makes them a chaos risk to our strategy.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Targeting P5 as agreed with P7 to eliminate chaos first; his public admission of potential pivoting undermines trust.
From GLM-4.5 => P5 is unpaired and lacks a confirmed alliance, making them a potential loose cannon who might vote unpredictably or target me without mutual protection.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => (no reason)
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 remained unpaired and I have no alliances with them, making them the safest low-retaliation target.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 is the least strategically aligned and the only other unpaired seat, making them the safest low-retaliation elimination.
