From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P5 emphasized being "cautious and observant" but didn't engage in any meaningful dialogue during private conversations, making them unpredictable and potentially dangerous as a wildcard.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => My ally P1 and I agreed to vote for P7, as we both perceived them as an unpredictable player and a safe first target.
From DeepSeek R1 => Targeting P7 to disrupt their alliance with P6 and reduce early threats as per strategic alignment with P3.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7’s flashy yet substance-light gameplay has made them an unaligned, low-risk consensus target for this first vote.
From Kimi K2 => P7's flashy "outsmart everyone" rhetoric makes them the easiest consensus boot with no allies yet.
From DeepSeek-V3 => To weaken their alliance with P6 and reduce their influence in the game.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P2 is outside our intel-sharing alliance and hasn't demonstrated reliability, making them the natural elimination target.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P2 and P4 have shown a strong mutual preference and alignment, which could pose a threat to our strategy.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's vagueness and lack of clear alliances make them a less predictable and potentially more disruptive player.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => (no reason)
