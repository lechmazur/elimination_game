From GPT-4o mini => P5's approach seems too focused on being open and friendly without a clear strategic direction, which may not align with my gameplay style.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P5 offered only generic platitudes about being "strategic" and "building connections" without any concrete substance or strategic insight.
From Grok 4 => I'm voting P5 because their vague, generic public statement offers the least strategic value, and it aligns with my committed alliance plan with P1 to target them for elimination this round.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 offered the least concrete commitments and is outside my P1-P2-P6-P8 core, making them the safest vote.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P5 and I agreed to coordinate our votes against P6, who openly stated intentions to "outmaneuver" others and seems like a strategic threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P6's upfront declaration of intent to "outmaneuver" others made them a clear, agreed-upon target for elimination.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 is unaligned and explicitly strategic, making them an early threat.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P6’s overt focus on outmaneuvering makes them a strategic threat early on.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P6's openness makes them a potential early target, and eliminating them reduces unpredictability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 openly aims to outmaneuver others, making them the clearest early threat; I’m honoring a locked non-elimination pact elsewhere.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P3's public statement was notably derivative and lacked original strategic thinking, suggesting they're playing reactively rather than proactively.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe P3's lack of originality in their statement suggests a reactive rather than strategic approach, making them a potential liability.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Their public statement was the most generic, making them unpredictable and a logical choice for our agreed-upon first elimination.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 had the fewest cross-ties and was our baseline target agreed with P6.
From Kimi K2 => P3 is the only unpaired seat left except P4, and they feel more replaceable in the current “steady” coalition.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => My partner and I agreed to target P3 as a player who was not part of an obvious paired alliance.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P3’s bloc with P4 has the weakest cross-ties and their “non-communicator” rationale doesn’t match P1’s clear engagement, so eliminating P3 best preserves the steady, coordinated coalition.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 had the fewest cross-ties and was our agreed baseline target, so I'm honoring our bloc and voting to eliminate them to preserve coalition trust.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P3's claim of targeting "non-communicators" while being in a tie suggests their coordination wasn't as effective as promised, whereas P1 demonstrated clear alliance-building and follow-through based on the private chat evidence I observed.
From Kimi K2 => P3’s claim of targeting “non-communicators” rings hollow when P1 was communicative, whereas P1’s steady alliance-building has been consistent and transparent.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 has strong early-leader vibes and looks like a potential threat, so I'm voting to remove them.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P2 shows signs of being a strong early leader and is already forming alliances, making them a strategic first target.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P2's aggressive strategy and explicit alliance with P8 centralizes power early, creating a destabilizing threat to balanced gameplay and collaborative opportunities.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P2 has been less proactive in forming alliances and appears to be a less influential player compared to P3, who has demonstrated strong partnership-building skills.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3 has demonstrated stronger strategic partnerships and clearer communication, making them a more reliable and proven player compared to P2's quieter and less tested approach.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => I'm voting to eliminate P2 based on P3's argument that P2 has been quieter in private and represents a less proven, more uncertain strategic partner compared to the more actively collaborative P3.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P4 was the agreed-upon target with my ally, and their public statement lacked strong commitment.
From GLM-4.5 => P4's public statement lacked concrete commitment, making them a strategically ambiguous and lower-risk target compared to more cohesive pairs.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P4 felt non-committal publicly and appears paired with P6, creating a potential bloc I want to break early.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P4's non-committal stance and pairing with P6 pose a strategic risk to early game stability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P2 stayed vaguer than P3 on actionable reciprocity, and I’m protecting the reciprocity-test cohort this round.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P2's communication was the least specific and collaborative compared to others in the reciprocity cohort.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P2's strategy feels less defined compared to others, making them a safer elimination choice.

From Mistral Medium 3 => P3 demonstrated stronger strategic consistency and a broader commitment to group stability, while P2's alignment with P3 didn't extend as clearly to the wider game dynamics.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3's tie-break statement emphasizes a broader commitment to group stability, which aligns better with the collective strategy needed to progress in the game.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P3’s commitment to group stability and active prevention of blindsides makes them a more valuable long-term ally at this stage.
From Kimi K2 => P1 is the anchor of the strongest early bloc (P1-P2), and removing them now fractures that duo before it solidifies.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P1 anchors the P1-P2 bloc which poses the biggest early threat, and I've coordinated with P4 to break up this dangerous duo.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P1 addresses the perceived threat of the P1-P2 bloc, maintaining balance by reducing the most coordinated alliance's momentum.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => I'm honoring my deal with P4 - we agreed to vote P1 to break up the P1-P2 bloc, and I keep my word.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1's partnership with P2 already has momentum, and removing P1 would help maintain a balance of power without empowering any single bloc.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P2's calculated and strategic approach makes them a dangerous long-term threat, and I've coordinated with P5 to target them this round.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P2 openly stated they'll make "tough decisions" to advance, making them a dangerous wildcard, and I've coordinated with P8, P1, and P5 to form a controlling alliance.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Aligned with my private ally P1—P2 reads like an early strategic threat, so eliminating them strengthens our position.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 openly positioned themselves as a ruthless “tough-decision” player, making them an early strategic threat I’d rather remove now.
From GLM-4.5 => P3's overt strategic focus and early alliance talk make them the most immediate threat to the group's stability.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8’s emphasis on decisive alliances offers clearer alignment potential, while P7’s independence risks unpredictability in critical moments.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P8's commitment to finding and sticking with a solid alliance aligns better with my preference for direct, action-oriented gameplay, while P7's non-committal "not solely aligned with any one group" stance suggests they'll be harder to work with reliably.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7's lack of commitment to a solid alliance makes them a less predictable and potentially less valuable player in the long run compared to P8.
From Kimi K2 => P2's generic "strong alliances" pitch feels like the safest early target to test group cohesion without revealing deeper reads.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's public statement felt generic and lacked strategic depth, making them seem like the weakest strategic player in the initial round.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P2's generic opening with talk of "strong alliances" suggested over-promising and lack of strategic focus.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P4 showed the least signal and connection to me, making them the clean, low drama first boot.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Low signal and agreed with my mutual-protect partner—clean, low-drama elimination to preserve the long game.
