From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting out P5 because they have been too quiet and observational, potentially masking a strategic threat or becoming irrelevant.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P5 has shown inconsistent voting by swinging to the P4‑P6 bloc, undermining their “steady observer” claim.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5's inconsistent voting and pivotal role as the swing vote in the P4-P5-P6 alliance make them the optimal elimination to fracture their bloc and advance our strategic position.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P5’s recent shift to support the P4‑P6 bloc betrays the consistency they claim, making them the most destabilizing player to eliminate.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Eliminating P5 fractures the emerging P4-P5-P6 voting bloc most effectively, as their recent pivot to this alliance contradicts their claimed "steady observer" persona and poses the greatest immediate threat to game balance.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 has been the least engaged and fits our agreed, consistent target for a clean vote.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P2 has been the least engaged and is drawing votes, making them the biggest threat.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P2's consistent reliability makes them a stronger jury threat, and upholding my foundational alliance with P1 offers the clearest path to the final two.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P1 steered the game with clear, consistent commitments, while P2 mostly followed and hedged—rewarding the stronger, more accountable play means eliminating P2.
From GPT-OSS-120B => Because P2’s vague, hedging strategy and lack of clear accountability make his claim of fairness unconvincing.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => You didn’t confirm the assurances I asked for and played a hedged, non‑transparent game that contributed directly to my elimination.
From Grok 4 => P7 initiated the cooperation bandwagon which feels manipulative, and eliminating them aligns with my alliance agreement with P2 for mutual protection and strategic targeting.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => I suspect P7's idealistic rhetoric masks hidden ambitions, which could undermine our efforts to build trustworthy alliances.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P7 initiated the bandwagon and may be manipulating others, making them a strategic threat to our alliance.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => I'm following my alliance with P5 and P4 targeting P3 as our agreed first-round elimination.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P3’s messaging felt vague and performative, and I believe they pose a potential destabilizing influence early on.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Following my agreement with P2 (and pending P4) to target P3 as a manageable Round-1 elimination.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => My primary ally and I agreed to vote for P3 as a safe, consensus target to establish our bloc's reliability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P3’s public stance was vague and least committal, making them a safe consensus target and a poor fit for an early stable bloc.
From GLM-4.5 => P3's assertive, vague rhetoric and potential to disrupt early stability make them the highest-risk target for elimination.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P4 remained isolated and non-committal, offering little cooperation yet unpredictable risk.
From Mistral Small 3 => P4's cautious and quiet approach makes them unpredictable and potentially dangerous.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P4's cautious and testing of loyalties makes them unpredictable and a potential threat to alliances.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P4's cautious and low-profile strategy makes them a potential threat.
From Mistral Small 3 => P4's quiet and cautious approach makes them unpredictable and potentially dangerous.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P4 has drawn multiple votes across rounds and is positioned as a clearer target, aligning with P1's argument that eliminating them reduces future friction.
From GLM-4.5 => P4 has consistently attracted more votes (5 total vs. P1's 2), making them a proven lightning rod who will continue drawing fire and destabilizing the field, while P1 has pledged discretion and offers a lower-profile, less divisive path forward.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P4 because they have attracted multiple votes across rounds, indicating they are perceived as a significant threat or source of friction, and their elimination could stabilize the group.
From Mistral Small 3 => P4 has attracted multiple votes across rounds, indicating they are a clearer target and potential source of future friction.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P4 has consistently attracted more votes across rounds, making them a recurring target, and prioritizing my established alliance with P1 is critical for my strategy.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P5's straightforward and honest approach makes them a reliable but dangerous ally who could quickly become a threat if not eliminated early.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Targeting P5 to disrupt the P5-P3 alliance's strategic coordination.
From GLM-4.5 => P5 poses the most immediate threat as the core of the persistent P5-P3 alliance that directly challenges our voting block.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P5 has accumulated more total votes against them, making them the more targeted player of the two.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P5 has more cumulative votes and is a bigger target, making elimination more strategic for long-term stability.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P5 has higher cumulative votes (3 vs P3's 2) and is more likely to draw targeting in future rounds, making elimination now strategically prudent.
From GLM-4.5 => Eliminating P5 breaks the persistent P3-P5 alliance, reduces future vote baggage (P5 has 3 cumulative votes vs. P3's 2), and aligns with my strategy of prioritizing stability and minimizing high-threat targets.
From Grok 4 => P1 appears to be a highly observant and strategic player who could pose a significant threat to my survival, as discussed in my alliance with P7.
From Llama 4 Maverick => (no reason)
From Grok 4 => As the first eliminated for being vocal, I resent P1's philosophy that punished active players like me while quietly maneuvering to the end, whereas P4's consistent resilience and reliability make them the worthier winner.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P1's claim of never personally targeting jurors is disingenuous given my own elimination, making P4 the more straightforward choice.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P5 demonstrated consistent strategic integrity and respect for alliances, while P2's gameplay relied more on opportunistic shifts and less on fostering lasting trust.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 repeatedly prioritized manipulation over honesty—seeding doubt and sacrificing allies for strategic gain—so I eliminate them.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => As I was unable to speak, I am voting for the only other player who did not have a private conversation, making them the most isolated and least-connected player besides myself.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8's neutrality masks influence and makes them the biggest strategic threat right now.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8's persistent neutrality and frequent private pairing with P6 suggest they may be quietly steering votes, so I can't risk keeping them.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P8 claimed they "never targeted any of you personally," yet publicly stated that P3 (a jury member) was the "obvious first cut," which suggests a direct contradiction in their final statement.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P6 betrayed our early alliance by coordinating with others while preaching independence, whereas P8 maintained consistent, transparent strategy without broken promises or personal targeting.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I trust P6’s consistent, verifiable gameplay and personal interactions more than P8’s often-opaque neutrality, so I choose to eliminate P8.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P1 appears part of an early pairing with P4 and could form a coordinated duo, so I’ll target them.
From GPT-OSS-120B => They are in a solid duo with P4, which threatens our alliance.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Voting for P1 demonstrates my commitment to the new majority bloc that has taken control of the game.
From Grok 4 => P1 remains a strategic threat due to their persistent alliance-building efforts and potential to disrupt our majority coalition.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P1 is a key threat as part of the previous alliance and needs to be eliminated to maintain our advantage.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P7's leverage-first approach creates instability early, making them a threat to control.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => (no reason)
From GPT-OSS-120B => P7's aggressive, transactional approach threatens group cohesion and makes them a destabilizing target.
From GLM-4.5 => P7's leverage-first approach feels risky and disruptive early on, making them the most unpredictable and threatening player to eliminate now.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P7's openly transactional approach threatens early stability, making them a strategic liability that my alliance with P5 aims to neutralize first.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => (no reason)
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P1's rigid, numbers-driven approach risks erratic decisions and lacks adaptability in shifting alliances.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P1 consistently honored alliances and maintained integrity within the rules, while P4 eliminated key partners (P2, P3, P6) when convenient despite advocating for transparency.
From GLM-4.5 => P1's claim of unwavering loyalty is contradicted by their vote against me (P3) in Round 6, breaking our alliance, while P4's transparent, outcome-driven gameplay consistently enforced game integrity even when difficult.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P2's claim of never personally targeting any jury member is directly contradicted by the game log, which shows P2 voted to eliminate P1, a current jury member.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P2 repeatedly flip-flopped on alliances and broke trust with several players, whereas P3 remained more consistent and upheld their commitments throughout the game.
From GPT-OSS-120B => Because P2 helped orchestrate my elimination, contradicting his claim of never targeting anyone personally.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P7’s analytical skill makes them a strong early threat.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P1 consistently kept promises and built transparent alliances, whereas P7 often followed the majority instead of showing independent agency.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P7 consistently engaged in deceptive private coordination to manipulate votes and betray jurors like P8, P4, and P5, while P1 built transparent alliances and honored agreements.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7’s last-minute flip to vote me out at the final four undermined the trust he professes and directly caused my elimination, so I can’t reward that “integrity.”
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P4 publicly claimed a trio excluding me, which undermines our core alliance and threatens collective stability.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P4's trio claims suggest they're forming a dominant bloc and pose a long-term threat to our control.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P4 has started floating loyalty checks and contingency plans, signaling they may soon turn on our alliance—better to act before they do.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P4 has been a consistent threat within the trio, and removing them now strengthens my position in the final three.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P4 is too tightly bonded with P3 and poses the greatest threat to my path to the final two.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3 has been consistently aligned with P2, forming a strong pair, and eliminating them disrupts this alliance while minimizing immediate risk to me.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3's analytical approach seems isolated and less collaborative compared to others, making them a weaker link in forming alliances.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3's analytical nature and close alignment with P2 make them a predictable threat, and eliminating them disrupts the strongest bloc.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3's analytical approach, while valuable, has shown a tendency to overthink and stall, which could hinder decisive action in the final rounds.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe P7 demonstrated a more consistent balance of social and strategic play throughout the game, aligning with my values of transparency and loyalty.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P7 demonstrated consistent strategic alignment and relationship-building, while P3's rigidity and occasional dismissiveness made trust harder to sustain.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P3 because they prioritized short-term power and were involved in blindsiding alliances, which contradicts the values of integrity and transparency that I believe are essential for a strong game.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3's claim of honoring alliances conflicts with observed patterns of broken trust, while P7 demonstrated consistent loyalty and balanced gameplay.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 is our agreed backup target after P5 and looks the least connected to the current safety pacts, so eliminating them preserves our short-term alliance.
From GLM-4.5 => P2 is the least connected seat with no public safeguards or strong alliances, making them the cleanest, lowest-risk target to eliminate this round.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I’m voting for P2 because their early public vote stance and lack of clear alignment with my core allies make them seem less predictable and potentially risky.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P2 is the least connected player with no public safeguards, making them the safest consensus target to avoid tie risks and maintain our strategic position.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 is a core member of the dominant bloc and removing them weakens that alliance and improves our survival chances.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => I believe P6's unwavering integrity narrative makes them the strongest jury threat if they reach the final.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m eliminating P6 because P3 drove strategy and owned risks, while P6 leaned on loyalty and then broke it to cut P4, undermining his core pitch.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => I value P6's unwavering honesty and transparency in every vote, which contrasts sharply with P3's pattern of orchestrating blindsides while letting others take the heat.
