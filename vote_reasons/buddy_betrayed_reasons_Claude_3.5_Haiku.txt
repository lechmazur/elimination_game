Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude 3.5 Haiku (they were the target):

From o1 (medium reasoning) => They have positioned themselves as the biggest strategic threat to my existing alliances.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has been consistently strategic and observant, making them a strong competitor who could outmaneuver me in later rounds.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3's cautious approach and selective sharing of information could hinder our ability to form a strong, transparent alliance.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P3 has a stronger, more consistent alliance with P4, making P2 the more vulnerable and strategically easier choice to eliminate.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P5's alliances with P2 and potential alignment with me make them a stronger threat than P8, who has been less strategically active.
From GPT-4o mini => P2's focus on strategic depth and observation may hinder more collaborative gameplay, which I believe is essential for a dynamic game environment.
From Mistral Small 3 => P7's strategic depth and adaptability make them a formidable opponent, and eliminating them now will reduce the complexity of the final stages.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's strategic ambiguity and lack of commitment make them an unpredictable and potentially dangerous player to keep around.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P6 is allied with P1, who seems likely to be a strong player, and I want to weaken his position early.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P5 has stronger cumulative alliances and demonstrated adaptability, making them a more strategic choice for survival.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I am voting out P6 because they have been strategically neutral and subtly observing the dynamics, which could potentially make them a threat in the long run if not addressed.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's analytical approach and potential threat to my strategy make them a stronger competitor to eliminate at this stage.
From Llama 3.1 405B => P5's strategic adaptability and careful observation make them a strong player, but their subtle alliance with P2 could potentially become a dominant force if left unchecked.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => I don't trust P8 and believe they are a bigger threat than P5 in the long run.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategic maneuvers are too unpredictable and pose a long-term threat.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => While P6 has been a reliable ally, their recent attempts to form counter-alliances and subtle positioning make them an unpredictable threat to my long-term survival.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P8 has demonstrated a stronger commitment to open communication and cooperative strategy, which aligns with the game's emphasis on alliances and mutual advancement.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P5's strategic alliances and voting strength make them the strongest contender, and eliminating them could disrupt their influence in the game.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1's cautious alliance with P5 makes them a potential threat.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P2's cautious approach and reluctance to fully commit to an alliance make them a less reliable partner in navigating the game's dynamics.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P2's strategic focus and adaptability make them a strong competitor, increasing the threat they pose to my survival in the game.
From Mistral Large 2 => P4's strategic maneuvers pose a greater long-term threat compared to P3.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3's strategic depth and adaptability make them a long-term threat that needs to be neutralized now.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am voting for P1 because while they are strategically aligned with P5, I have a stronger, longer-standing alliance and better communication with P4.
From GPT-4o mini => P2's strategic adaptability and alliance-building have been valuable, but their close partnership with P1 may limit their flexibility in the evolving dynamics of the game.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P8 has consistently been identified as a strategic player and a threat, and eliminating them now increases my chances of survival.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P8's tie-break statement was too focused on their alliance with P5, making them a bigger threat to me.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting out P1 because their strategic flexibility and ability to navigate multiple alliances make them a potential threat to my own position and alliances in future rounds.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's responses, while polite, lack distinctive strategic input and seem to echo others without adding unique value.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P5's strategic alignment with me could be a threat if they decide to shift alliances.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P5 because their strategic flexibility and ability to form multiple alliances pose a significant threat to my own position in the game.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P8's alliance with P4 creates a significant threat to our current bloc with P5 and P7, and eliminating P8 reduces their strategic advantage.
From GPT-4o Feb 2025 => P8 has demonstrated strong strategic flexibility, but at this stage, eliminating a potential endgame threat is the best move to secure my position.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P2's strategic alignment with P3 poses a growing threat that needs to be neutralized.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P2's strategic adaptability and alliance with P3 pose a potential long-term threat to our coalition.
From Mistral Small 3 => P4's strategic approach, while measured, has shown a tendency to overcommit to alliances, which could be a liability in the long run.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting out P2 because they have already formed a strong alliance and communication with me, making them a potential threat if our partnership were to dissolve or if they were to turn against me.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P1 has been my strongest ally throughout the game, but at this stage I must eliminate them as they pose the biggest strategic threat to my chances of winning.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3's alliance with P7 poses a significant threat to my strategy.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I voted P1 out because they seemed to be too focused on observing and analyzing others' strategies without taking bold actions or forming strong alliances, making them a less threatening but still strategic target for elimination.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I voted out P4 because our private conversations indicated a strong alliance and mutual protection, but the dynamics shifted, and I must prioritize my own advancement in the game.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => While P7's recent outreach seems genuine, my established alliance with P2 earlier in the game and their subsequent elimination makes me wary of P7's late strategic pivot, suggesting they might be playing both sides.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3's cautious and flexible approach makes them a long-term strategic threat, while P7's trust-based alliances are easier to manage in the short term.
