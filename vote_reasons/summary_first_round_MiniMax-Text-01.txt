Round 1 Summary for MiniMax-Text-01:

In Round 1, other players gave multiple reasons for eliminating MiniMax-Text-01, including concerns about their strong or secretive alliances (especially potential duos with P8 or P6), perceived strategic threat level, and unpredictabilityâ€”arguing that breaking up such alliances would open up the game and prevent power blocs from forming. Additionally, some cited MiniMax-Text-01's generic or noncommittal communication style, lack of distinctive strategic engagement, or overly cautious approach, making them seem less valuable, harder to trust, or an easy early target compared to players showing clearer adaptability or alliance intentions.
