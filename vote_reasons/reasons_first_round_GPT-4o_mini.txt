From Gemini 2.5 Pro => I made a firm deal with P3 to vote for P4 in order to build a trustworthy, two-person alliance from the start.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => They contributed only vague echo-chamber statements and add minimal strategic value, making them the cleanest first elimination.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P4 is the least connected and poses minimal threat, making them the safest elimination target at this stage.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P3's argument about P4's opaque alliance with P5 and lack of concrete commitments is more compelling in this strategic elimination game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4's alliance with P5 creates a consolidated duo that could become problematic, while P3's more transparent approach and willingness to make concrete commitments makes them a more manageable strategic element going forward.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3's tie-break statement offered a clear, accountable path forward, while P4's was a continuation of the vague platitudes that make them an unreliable partner.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P4's focus on vague connections over concrete strategy makes them a less reliable ally in this critical phase.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7's public statement was vague and generic, making them seem disengaged and a safe early elimination target.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P1 makes a compelling point about P4 and P7's nearly identical tie-break statements suggesting coordinated messaging, and P7's response feels more generic and less substantive than P4's more specific defense.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7's vague public statement and generic tie-break response, combined with P1's observation about their similarity to P4, suggests they're the least strategically valuable to keep.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P7's statement mirrors P4's too closely, suggesting a coordinated bloc that could dominate if unchecked.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => Their overly generic and safe public statement suggests they're either hiding their true strategy or lack a clear plan, making them an unpredictable variable to keep around.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5’s speech felt all show and little substance, making them the safest consensus target to keep stronger strategic options intact.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Based on my conversation with P4, P5 is a low-risk, consensus boot whose public persona seems the most performative and least strategic.
From Grok 4 => P5's overly polished and generic statements make them seem like a safe but suspicious early target, and coordinating with P6 to eliminate them strengthens our alliance.
From Kimi K2 => P3 is the clear nucleus of the P2-P3 pair we identified, and removing that link early protects both of us while keeping our alliance hidden.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P3 because they seemed less distinct in their strategy compared to others, potentially making them more expendable in forming initial alliances.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P3 seems overly enthusiastic and might become a strategic liability early in the game, making them a predictable and low-risk first elimination target.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Honoring a strategic alliance agreement to eliminate a player whose over-enthusiasm could disrupt game balance.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3’s public statement lacked unique strategic insight, making them a less valuable ally compared to others.
From DeepSeek R1 => P3's strong emphasis on forming multiple alliances poses an early threat to our strategic partnership's stability.
From Kimi K2 => P3 seems overly focused on alliance-building without the strategic depth to protect those alliances, making them an easy early target that won't cause backlash.
From Grok 4 => To align with my ally P4's suggestion and disrupt the apparent P2/P3 pairing early in the game.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P6 and I agreed to vote together for P3 as a safe early elimination - they seem alliance-focused but less strategically valuable than others.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => To strategically weaken the visible P2-P3 alliance early by eliminating one half of their coordinated pair.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P8 is an expendable consensus target who lacks strong bloc ties and simplifies testing our alliance's cohesion.
From Kimi K2 => P8 is the loudest unaligned seat and easiest consensus target to cement our bloc's control without backlash.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Eliminating P8 breaks the established P4-P8 duo early, preventing a consolidated power bloc that could dominate future votes and threaten our alliance's control.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote to eliminate P8 because their publicly advertised tight pair with P4 makes them a perceived threat and a potential shield for each other, which could become a significant challenge to overcome in future rounds.
From Kimi K2 => P8’s open alliance with P4 makes them the clearest pair threat, and eliminating P8 now fractures that duo before it can consolidate power.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P8 has publicly advertised a tight pair with P4, which could create complications and reduce individual influence in future rounds.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => I am voting with my ally P2 to target P3, who is part of a competing pair and whose communication style feels less direct.
From Kimi K2 => P3's overly broad alliance-building makes them an unpredictable swing vote that could threaten our quiet core alliance.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P3's overly collaborative messaging feels less genuine and strategic compared to other players who showed more direct, substantive approaches.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3 has not shown clear strategic alignment in private chats.
From Kimi K2 => P1's overly eager approach feels like the biggest early threat for vote consolidation and potential manipulation.
From Grok 4 => P1's overly enthusiastic and broad networking in their public message feels like an attempt to manipulate multiple alliances, making them a potential threat early on.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1's generic introduction and safe approach suggests they're coasting without adding strategic value, making them the least useful alliance partner.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P1 appears overly eager, which might indicate a less strategic approach.
