Buddy Betray reasons by Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05:

From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => P7 admitted to breaking their word on a locked-in vote, and trust is the only thing that matters to me in this game.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => My strategy has always been to break up the most powerful bloc, and P4's vote made it clear my own alliance had become the new target.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => P8 is the last player outside of my core alliance with P4 and P6, and their elimination is the logical next step for our group's strategy.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => Voting for P3 is the logical next step for our majority alliance to advance to the final three.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => You betrayed our explicit agreement in the last round, proving you cannot be trusted.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => The previous vote revealed a new majority has formed, and fighting it guarantees a loss on the tie-breaker, so I must adapt to survive.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => P6 is the last remaining player outside of my established majority alliance with P2 and P8.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => P2's argument is correct; P4's minimal vote history makes him the largest threat in the final two, and I must vote to maximize my own chances of winning.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => P2 blatantly lied to me in a transparent attempt to trick me into my own elimination.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => My alliance with P8 has failed and our continued association makes us both targets, so I must sever the tie to prove my willingness to adapt to the majority.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => Eliminating P1 is the final, logical step in my strategy of breaking up the game's original, most rigid pairs to ensure a truly reset endgame.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 => You betrayed our alliance in the last round, proving you were an opportunist, not a partner.
