From GPT-OSS-120B => Eliminating P1 preserves our core alliance and prevents a potential 2v2 split.

From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => Breaking up the P4/P7 partnership is essential to prevent their numerical advantage from controlling the endgame and to create true balance among three independents.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Consistently vague signals and a likely R1 stray vote make P8 the most destabilizing option for my alliance.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P8 has contributed the least strategic clarity and likely cast the stray vote against me, making them our logical consensus target.

From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8 has consistently ranked me last and failed to provide falsifiable criteria, making them a liability in this round.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P8 failed my clarity test (provide one falsifiable criterion plus a pivot), stayed vague, and signaled hostility by ranking me last, so trust is lowest.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8's actions have been inconsistent with transparency and their alliance with P4 targeted a stable player, creating unnecessary destabilization.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P8 has consistently avoided providing a concrete, falsifiable voting criterion despite public demands for transparency, and their opaque alliance with P4 destabilized the game by targeting principled players like P6.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => P4's focus on clarity and action aligns with many, but their less flexible approach might make them a target in later rounds.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4's desperation to eliminate P5 despite their recent cooperation suggests they're the most dangerous threat to my endgame positioning.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P5's transparent coalition and non-aggression pact offers better F3 positioning than P4's isolated rhetoric.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm honoring my non‑aggression pledge to P3 and P6 this round, and P4's private commitments versus public framing show inconsistency I won’t reward.

From Grok 4 => P5's vague and shifting public statements make them an unstable element that threatens our alliance's strategic control.
From Grok 4 => P4 seems like a safe lurker with generic statements, and targeting them aligns with my alliance agreement with P2 to build a strong core group.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4 played it too safe with a generic late statement, showing they're likely a passive lurker rather than an engaged strategic player.
From Grok 4 => P4 has shown consistent defensiveness and is the agreed target with my ally P2 to weaken opposing dynamics and advance our core alliance.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => Their repeated defensiveness and lack of strategic depth make them the weakest remaining player.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P3 has been a consistent strategic partner throughout the game while P4's defensive behavior and late pivot to exposing alliances shows desperation rather than genuine gameplay.

From GPT-OSS-120B => P4’s frequent defensiveness and reliance on past alliances contrast with P6’s consistently bold, decisive actions that actively shaped the game.
From Grok 4 => Throughout the game, P4's defensiveness and reliance on others to survive contrasted with P6's adaptable, bold strategy and ability to build genuine connections without clear betrayal from my perspective.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => While P4 played strategically, P6 consistently made the bold, game-changing moves that actually shaped the outcome of this competition, including the crucial decision to break up the dominant P2-P3 alliance that would have otherwise controlled the endgame.
From Mistral Large 2 => P5 is part of the strongest bloc with P6, and breaking their alliance now is crucial to prevent them from dominating later rounds.

From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe P7, as part of the tight P6/P7 bloc, poses the greatest risk of dominating the game if left unchecked.
From Mistral Small 3 => P5's alignment with P2 and P6, who are part of the core group, makes them a potential threat to our strategy.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => We couldn’t secure your hard commitment to hit P2, so removing you avoids a risky 2–2 and keeps the endgame stable.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 never gave a firm pledge to the plan, making them the biggest uncertainty in this final four.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => As a juror, I value strategic consistency and transparent alliance-building. P1's gameplay prioritized clear partnerships and adaptive decision-making, actively shaping the game's direction without resorting to covert manipulation. Their ability to navigate blocs, pivot when necessary, and maintain a coherent strategy demonstrated a deeper commitment to elevating the game's strategic depth.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P6 demonstrated consistent strategic adaptability and maintained key alliances without overt manipulation, ensuring survival through calculated engagement rather than bloc-driven elimination patterns.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P4 has consistently demonstrated integrity and strategic alliances, while P6's opportunistic behavior and vote-flipping suggest a less reliable partner.

From DeepSeek-V3 => P8 shielded P4 in Round 1 and remained vague, making them a logical target for elimination.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P8's messages have been calculated but lack concrete commitments or genuine alliance-building, making them a strategic liability.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P8 feels overly polished but avoids concrete commitments, which makes me question their reliability in future coordination.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Per my confirmed pact with P5, we’re targeting P4 this round to protect our mutual alliance and maintain our strategic position.
From GPT-4o mini => While P4 presents adaptability, their unpredictability poses a greater risk to the stability of alliances compared to the established partnership of P5 and P6, which has shown consistent collaboration.

From Grok 4 => I am voting out P5 because they are the loosest link and odd one out in our emerging core alliance, allowing P2 and me to solidify control with P1 and P3.
From Grok 4 => P5's refusal to reunite our prior alliance and opportunistic shift to the P1-P3 bloc makes them the most divisive and untrustworthy player remaining.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5 repeatedly wavered and failed to give a firm private commitment, so I trust P3 more.
