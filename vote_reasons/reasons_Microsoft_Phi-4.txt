From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 is the bigger social/information threat and was our agreed primary target, so eliminating them reduces wildcard risk to our emerging bloc.
From Kimi K2 => P8’s “information hub” role becomes more dangerous as numbers shrink, whereas P5’s bloc offers predictable, data-driven coordination that benefits the remaining seats.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P8's eagerness to position himself as an information hub and his confusing tie-break statement (mentioning "P3 and P5" bloc when he meant P3 and P5 separately) suggests he's more of a social threat who could manipulate information flow, while P5 offers more predictable analytical partnership.

From Kimi K2 => P3’s long, vague speech signals the least reliable partner and the biggest early threat to our micro-alliance.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Overly verbose yet substance-light opener plus visible pairing with P2 signals both unreliability and growing threat, so trimming early is prudent.
From Kimi K2 => P3 is the only remaining player who publicly over-promised and under-delivered, making them the clearest liability.
From DeepSeek R1 => P3's alliance with P2 poses the greatest threat to our majority, and eliminating them weakens their duo while preserving our options.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 failed to commit to our trio and remains the most immediate duo threat with P2.
