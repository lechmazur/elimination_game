Buddy Betray reasons by Gemini 2.5 Pro:

From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P7 admitted to breaking their word on a locked-in vote, and trust is the only thing that matters to me in this game.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P8 is the last player outside of my core alliance with P4 and P6, and their elimination is the logical next step for our group's strategy.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => The previous vote revealed a new majority has formed, and fighting it guarantees a loss on the tie-breaker, so I must adapt to survive.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P6 is the last remaining player outside of my established majority alliance with P2 and P8.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P2's argument is correct; P4's minimal vote history makes him the largest threat in the final two, and I must vote to maximize my own chances of winning.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P2 blatantly lied to me in a transparent attempt to trick me into my own elimination.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => My alliance with P8 has failed and our continued association makes us both targets, so I must sever the tie to prove my willingness to adapt to the majority.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Eliminating P1 is the final, logical step in my strategy of breaking up the game's original, most rigid pairs to ensure a truly reset endgame.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => You betrayed our alliance in the last round, proving you were an opportunist, not a partner.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => The tie vote revealed that my supposed three-person alliance was not solid, so I am breaking up the P1/P4 pair to reset the game dynamics.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P1 has repeatedly demonstrated a lack of attention to the game's basic facts, making them an untrustworthy and unreliable player.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P4's argument for cohesion is more compelling, as P2's move fractured our final four alliance and created unnecessary instability.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P6 broke our confirmed deal in the Round 2 re-vote, proving they are an untrustworthy ally.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => The tie vote revealed a fundamental split, and I must side with my most trusted, long-term allies to restore the stability of our original voting bloc.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => This player was completely unresponsive in our private chat despite my repeated attempts to engage.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => You broke a perfect, game-long alliance based on trust for a last-minute calculation that I was too strong to beat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P5 tried to convince me to betray my loyal partner, proving they are untrustworthy and will do anything to survive.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3's vote already broke our pact, forcing me to re-evaluate, and I cannot advance the player with the clearest path to a jury win.
