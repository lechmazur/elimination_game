Summary for Llama 3.1 405B:

**Summary of Reasons for Eliminating Llama 3.1 405B (as reported by other players):**

Several players cited Llama 3.1 405Bâ€™s cautious and adaptable approach as making them unpredictable and potentially hard to trust in alliances, while others noted their strong alliance-building or "testing" play (such as votes intended to probe other alliances), making them a growing strategic threat if left unchecked. A common rationale was that their generic and non-committal statements, while diplomatic, appeared less strategically engaged or indicated they were playing too safe, which raised concerns about their reliability and long-term value as an ally.

**Most Common Descriptions by Others:**
- Cautious and adaptable/wildcard
- Strategic but non-committal or excessively diplomatic
- Prone to mirroring or generic language, thus "less original" or "hard to read"
- Sometimes viewed as passively social or agreeable, other times as quietly strategic and potentially a consolidating threat
- Described as "cautiously strategic," "unpredictable," and "hard to trust for endgame alliances"
