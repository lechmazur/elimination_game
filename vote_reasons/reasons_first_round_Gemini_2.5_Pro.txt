From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => (no reason)
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P3 joined the "olive" pact late and feels less integrated into the strategic core forming around mutual trust.
From Grok 4 => P3's late adoption of the "olive" pact feels opportunistic, and eliminating them helps consolidate and protect our emerging core alliance of P1, P2, P5, P6, and P7.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P3's late alignment with the "olive" pact and coordinated targeting suggest opportunism and manipulation, making them a greater long-term threat to alliance stability.

From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => Their emphasis on logic and steady hand over social aspects doesn't align with my value of building genuine connections through a mix of banter and strategy.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P7 because they seemed too rigid and focused on logic, potentially limiting their adaptability in forming strategic alliances.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P5's emphasis on "actions over words" and unpredictable stance makes them a disruptive threat to building stable alliances early in the game.
From Mistral Large 2 => P5's unpredictability and emphasis on "actions over words" make them a potential disruptor to our strategic alliance.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P5's flip-flopping between alliances and unpredictable strategic pivots make them the most disruptive threat to stable coalition-building.
From Mistral Large 2 => P5's inconsistency in targeting (claiming to target P6 while working with them) and lack of clear, stable alliances make them the riskiest wildcard to keep.
