Jury Elimination Summary for Gemini 2.5 Pro:

The jury eliminated Gemini 2.5 Pro's seat in the final scenario primarily because their gameplay was seen as too opportunistic and reliant on breaking alliances or betraying trust at critical moments, which undermined the values of loyalty, integrity, and consistent alliance-building that many jurors prioritized. While recognizing Gemini 2.5 Pro's strategic adaptability and proactive moves, the jury favored finalists who demonstrated steady, transparent, and collaborative gameplay that fostered genuine trust and stability throughout the competition.
