Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for Kimi K2:

From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P1 actively shaped the game and steered the votes, while P2's strategy was to coast passively under the shields P1 created.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P1 consistently demonstrated strategic integrity by forming alliances and making calculated moves, while P2 benefited from these alliances without actively contributing to shaping outcomes.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P1's narrative of strategic integrity clashes with their own history of calculated eliminations, while P2's consistent pragmatism and lack of personal vendettas align better with long-term stability, making P2 the more trustworthy finalist.
From DeepSeek R1 => P1 demonstrated active strategic influence by forming key alliances and steering votes against threats, whereas P2's quieter, reactive approach offered less tangible impact on shaping outcomes.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I believe P1 demonstrated more genuine connections and adaptability, while P2's strategic moves, although effective, were not as personally engaging or loyal.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 was the strategic mastermind who consistently led their alliance's decision-making throughout the game, while P2's final accusation about P1 "breaking trust repeatedly" doesn't align with what I observed during our rounds together.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P2's strategic moves and consistent gameplay, despite P1's claims, align better with the competitive spirit and integrity of the game.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P3 because their statement, while emphasizing integrity and trust, subtly undermined P4's agency by suggesting they "survived by hiding behind stronger shields," which could be perceived as less proactive or strategic compared to P3's own actions.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P4 demonstrated superior strategic depth through our early alliance coordination and consistently showed the kind of calculated, multi-layered thinking that deserves to win this game.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => While both played strong games, P3's consistent adherence to alliances and demonstrated trustworthiness (protecting P4 early, no flips) aligns more with long-term strategic integrity compared to P4's more observational approach. Trust in elimination games often hinges on reliability, which P3 emphasized throughout.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P3's consistent integrity, protection of others, and refusal to flip votes align with the game's core values, whereas P4's strategic detachment and reliance on others' shields suggest a lack of decisive leadership needed to win.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7 played a more consistent and respectful game, avoiding unnecessary manipulation and backstabbing.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P6 voted against my ally P5 in the crucial Round 3 tie-break, showing the kind of alliance-flipping behavior that goes against the trust and loyalty I valued in this game.
From GPT-4o mini => P6's gameplay relied on manipulation and flipping alliances, which undermined trust and integrity, making P7 the more reliable choice for the win.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P1 maintained consistent, non-confrontational gameplay without burning alliances, while P4’s shifting loyalties (e.g., betraying P3, P5, P7) created distrust, making P1 the more reliable and strategically stable winner.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P1 largely coasted as a silent vote, while P4 actively shaped outcomes without needless theatrics, so I’m rewarding the player who combined strategy with consistent respect.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => While P1 played a consistent game of survival, P4 demonstrated superior strategic control and social awareness throughout, building meaningful alliances and steering the game's direction rather than just floating with the majority.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P4 demonstrated stronger strategic adaptability and social engagement, while P1's quiet approach, though consistent, lacked the initiative to build a compelling case for leadership.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P2 broke our mutual protection pact and then falsely claimed to have protected me when I was eliminated.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => While P2 emphasized loyalty, their alliances consistently failed to protect partners like P7 and P8, and their passive strategy lacked the adaptability P3 demonstrated in building genuine, effective coalitions.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P2 demonstrated unwavering loyalty and consistency, while P3's strategic adaptability was impressive but less reliable in maintaining alliances.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P5's final statement more accurately described the game, as P3 claimed integrity after casting the deciding vote to eliminate my alliance.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P3's consistent voting record and transparent alliances demonstrate a higher level of integrity and reliability compared to P5.

From Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) => P5 actively supported and allied with me in critical rounds to ensure my survival, while P3 voted against my close ally P1 and showed less direct engagement with me.
From Mistral Large 2 => P4 played a more transparent and strategic game, actively engaging with other players and honoring deals until necessary pivots, while P5's quiet and passive gameplay lacked proactive strategy.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's strategy relied on avoiding conflict and making few moves, while P4 demonstrated a more proactive approach and maintained transparency in alliances, which I believe is more deserving of the win.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P4 played a more transparent, strategic, and communicative game, while P5 coasted under the radar without taking meaningful risks or demonstrating leadership.
From GPT-4o mini => While P3 has demonstrated integrity, P2's strategic adaptability and coalition-building skills have been more impactful in navigating the game's complexities, making them the stronger candidate for the win.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Both of you betrayed my alliance, but P3's claim of playing with integrity and never betraying an ally is a complete fabrication of the game we all played.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P3 consistently demonstrated integrity through transparent stress-testing of alliances and bold strategic moves when necessary, while P2 often benefited from others' coordination without taking clear leadership or risks.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => While P1 claims loyalty, their passive "shadow play" strategy of letting others do the dirty work while keeping their hands clean feels less honorable than P4's more active and transparent gameplay throughout.
From Mistral Medium 3 => While P1 emphasizes loyalty, P4's strategic adaptability and consistent gameplay resonate more with the jury's experience of shifting alliances and calculated moves.
From Mistral Large 2 => P4's consistent strategy and adaptability outweigh P1's loyalty.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's emphasis on loyalty seems disingenuous given their past behavior of remaining passive while others took the risks; this game requires adaptability and strategic foresight, which P4 demonstrated effectively.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P2 demonstrated strategic foresight and consistency in gameplay, aligning more closely with the values of integrity and respect that the game emphasized.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P2’s pattern of opportunistic, short-term alliances burned bridges and undermined the genuine trust this game rewards.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => While P2 claims consistency, their "steering from shadows" approach and accumulation of 6 votes suggests they prioritized manipulation over genuine connections, whereas P3 maintained a more balanced and collaborative strategy throughout.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P3's consistent integrity and transparent gameplay align more with the values demonstrated throughout the competition.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => I found P1's explanation of their game more honest and consistent with the history than P3's.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P6 demonstrated more active control and strategic risk-taking in driving the game forward compared to P2's more passive approach.
From Mistral Small 3 => P2's consistent transparency and reliability, combined with P6's more aggressive and strategic approach, makes P2 the safer choice for a more balanced and fair game.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P6 played a more direct and consistent game according to their stated strategy, while P2's final statement felt less authentic.
