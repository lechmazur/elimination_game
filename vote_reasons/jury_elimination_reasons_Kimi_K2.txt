Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for Kimi K2:

From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P1 actively shaped the game and steered the votes, while P2's strategy was to coast passively under the shields P1 created.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P1 consistently demonstrated strategic integrity by forming alliances and making calculated moves, while P2 benefited from these alliances without actively contributing to shaping outcomes.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P1's narrative of strategic integrity clashes with their own history of calculated eliminations, while P2's consistent pragmatism and lack of personal vendettas align better with long-term stability, making P2 the more trustworthy finalist.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P2's strategic moves and consistent gameplay, despite P1's claims, align better with the competitive spirit and integrity of the game.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P3 because their statement, while emphasizing integrity and trust, subtly undermined P4's agency by suggesting they "survived by hiding behind stronger shields," which could be perceived as less proactive or strategic compared to P3's own actions.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => While both played strong games, P3's consistent adherence to alliances and demonstrated trustworthiness (protecting P4 early, no flips) aligns more with long-term strategic integrity compared to P4's more observational approach. Trust in elimination games often hinges on reliability, which P3 emphasized throughout.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P3's consistent integrity, protection of others, and refusal to flip votes align with the game's core values, whereas P4's strategic detachment and reliance on others' shields suggest a lack of decisive leadership needed to win.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7 played a more consistent and respectful game, avoiding unnecessary manipulation and backstabbing.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You publicly included me in your R4 “core” and then blindsided me, undermining your claim of clean, respectful play more than P4’s.
