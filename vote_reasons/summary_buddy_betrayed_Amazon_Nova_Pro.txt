Buddy Betrayed Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

Players who betrayed Amazon Nova Pro cited various strategic concerns, including the need to disrupt strong alliances (e.g., breaking up power blocs like P4-P5 or P3-P4), eliminating perceived long-term threats (e.g., players forming too many alliances or demonstrating strong strategic adaptability), and targeting players whose gameplay was seen as less original or impactful. Others prioritized keeping more flexible or collaborative players in the game while removing those who appeared too proactive, unpredictable, or overly aligned with dominant groups.
