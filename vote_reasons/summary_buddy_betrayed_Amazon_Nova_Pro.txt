Buddy Betrayed Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

Other players who betrayed the Amazon Nova Pro seat most often cited two main reasons: First, the seat was perceived as the pivotal player in several strong alliances or voting blocs (e.g., with P1, P4, or P8), and eliminating them would disrupt these power structures and prevent any one group from dominating the endgame. Second, the seat was consistently viewed as a strategic and adaptable competitor, whose ability to build relationships and shift alliances made them a significant long-term threat to others' chances of winning.
