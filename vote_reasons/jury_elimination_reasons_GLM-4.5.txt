Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for GLM-4.5:

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P4 demonstrated consistent strategic adaptability and earned broader trust through calculated moves, aligning with the jury's emphasis on balancing integrity and endgame foresight.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => While both played strategically, P6's claim of building bridges resonates more with my experience - they maintained consistent partnerships with P4 throughout, whereas P4's accusation of P6's "isolated plays" seems unfounded given their clear alliance.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P4's strategy, while analytical, appeared more reactive and less focused on building sustainable alliances compared to P6's consistent and cooperative approach.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P3 played a consistent, transparent game with steady alliances, and P4’s claim that P3 flipped loyalties doesn’t match the record.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P3 combined consistent loyalty with the decisive flexibility that steered key flips, while P4 largely coasted on that partnership, so P3 deserves the win.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P4’s baseless smear on P3’s loyalty revealed a readiness to distort facts, contradicting their own proclaimed integrity.

From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => While both played strategically, P4's final statement unfairly mischaracterizes P2's adaptable gameplay as "manipulation," ignoring that P2's cross-alliance coordination (like with me in Round 3) demonstrated essential social awareness in navigating shifting dynamics.
