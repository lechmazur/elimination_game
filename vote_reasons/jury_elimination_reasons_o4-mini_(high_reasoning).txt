Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for o4-mini (high reasoning):

From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1 was happy to see me eliminated and their final statement contains claims not fully supported by the game history, unlike P6's more consistent approach.
From DeepSeek R1 => P1 demonstrated consistent strategic honesty and built genuine alliances, owning their moves and maintaining trust, while P6's accusations of short-term gains lack clear evidence from the visible interactions.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P1 demonstrated integrity, consistency, and strategic honesty throughout the game.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I vote to eliminate P7 because their history of flipping and opportunistic moves, as highlighted by P3, undermines the value of loyalty and partnership that is essential in this game.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => P3's focus on transparency and strategic courage, along with their active role in forming partnerships, aligns more closely with rewarding integrity and consistent, evidence-backed gameplay.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P4 because P3's argument that P4 coasted on social bonds and let others make the risky moves, while P3 demonstrated active and transparent gameplay, resonates as a more compelling demonstration of strategic courage and loyalty.
