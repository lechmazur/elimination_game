Buddy Betrayed reasons for Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) (they were the target):

From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote out P3 because they have been relatively quiet and less proactive in forming strong alliances throughout the game.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's approach seems more passive and less strategically engaging compared to P7's proactive alliance-building and adaptable gameplay.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems less strategically committed and might be easier to manipulate compared to other remaining players.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 has demonstrated less consistent alliance-building and strategic depth compared to P1 and P7, making them the most strategic target to eliminate in this tie-break scenario.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) => P8 is attempting to disrupt my established alliances and poses a threat to my strategic position.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4's strategic moves and potential jury favorability pose a greater long-term threat.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your self‑vote last round showed you’re an unreliable end‑game partner, so I’m keeping the numbers steady.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1 has been too cautious and less proactive in forming strong alliances.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P8's strong alliance with me makes them a more influential target to ensure a clear path to victory.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P7's strategic independence and potential to form unpredictable alliances make them a greater long-term threat.
From Llama 4 Maverick => Eliminating P7 disrupts the strong P6-P7 alliance, potentially giving P3 more maneuverability in the final round.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5 seems too eager to form an alliance early, which could make them a strategic threat if they build too many connections.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P6's emphasis on adaptability and disrupting existing alliances poses a strategic threat by introducing unpredictability, while P5's focus on stability offers a more consistent partnership for navigating future rounds.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1's proven ability to form strong alliances and drive outcomes makes them a more predictable and manageable threat compared to P3's adaptability.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P5's trust in me is shaken after the R5 vote, making them a potential risk to my survival in future rounds.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P1 because they were too observant and were forming a potential alliance with me, making them a strategic threat if they aligned with another seat.
From GPT-4o mini => P3's focus on open communication seems less strategic compared to the others, making them a potential weak link in alliances.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P3’s late pivot felt opportunistic and unreliable compared to the steady alignment I’ve built with P5 and P6.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P4 has been less active in forming strong alliances and appears less strategically aligned with others.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => While our private conversations were cordial, P5 seems too cautious and observational, potentially making them a less dynamic threat compared to other players.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P6 seems to be the most aligned with the current majority and eliminating them could create a shift in dynamics.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P3's stable alliance with P1 poses a strategic threat, and eliminating them disrupts a key bloc, aligning with the goal of breaking dominant partnerships for a more open endgame.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P4 because eliminating them breaks the opposition and preserves the strategic alliance between P6 and P7, ensuring a stronger endgame.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8 has consistently shown minimal engagement and lacks strong alliances, making them a less predictable and valuable player compared to others in the tie.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted P8 out because they seem less integral to our mutual interests compared to P1 and P3.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3 has been less active in forming strategic alliances compared to others, making them a less valuable player in the endgame.

From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => My partnership with P2 has been the strategic foundation of my entire game, and I need to honor that loyalty in the final vote.
From Llama 4 Maverick => (no reason)
From GPT-4o mini => P4's approach seems overly focused on building alliances while neglecting the competitive nature of the game, which could lead to potential disruption in future rounds.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s late pivot to fracture the bloc shows opportunism over proven reliability; keeping P2 preserves the stable alliance that has delivered every round.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s quiet duo with P2 is the most consolidated threat; breaking it now keeps the field open and prevents a steamroll bloc.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P6 has shown consistent coordination with P7, which could disrupt the remaining alliances.
From Kimi K2 => P5 is the last remaining obstacle to our P1/P4/P8 alliance reaching the final three, and keeping them risks them flipping to the jury's preferred narrative.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P3's focus on adaptability and open strategic dialogue makes them a potential wildcard, whereas P5 and P7 have demonstrated more stable alliances and clearer strategies.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7's emphasis on open communication has not translated into effective alliances, as evidenced by the tie.
From Kimi K2 => P8 is the last obstacle outside our proven three-vote bloc, and removing them secures our path to the final three.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 is the only unaligned seat openly seeking to flip the majority against me, so removing them secures my position.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => I made a concrete commitment to P2 last round to vote P3 at final 4, and honoring my word is fundamental to how I build trust and play this game.
