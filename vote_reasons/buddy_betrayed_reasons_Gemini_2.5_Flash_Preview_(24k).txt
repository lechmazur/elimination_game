Buddy Betrayed reasons for Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) (they were the target):

From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P3 has consistently demonstrated strong strategic play and alliance-building, making them the biggest threat to win in the finale.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote out P3 because they have been relatively quiet and less proactive in forming strong alliances throughout the game.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P6 because their fixed alliance with P1 poses a significant threat to the balance of the game, and removing them would allow for more flexible and dynamic strategic interactions among the remaining players.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's approach seems more passive and less strategically engaging compared to P7's proactive alliance-building and adaptable gameplay.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems less strategically committed and might be easier to manipulate compared to other remaining players.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 has demonstrated less consistent alliance-building and strategic depth compared to P1 and P7, making them the most strategic target to eliminate in this tie-break scenario.

From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your self‑vote last round showed you’re an unreliable end‑game partner, so I’m keeping the numbers steady.

From Mistral Large 2 => P1 has been too cautious and less proactive in forming strong alliances.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P7 because their long-standing alliance with P6 could potentially dominate the endgame, and removing this predictability could introduce more dynamic strategic possibilities.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P8's strong alliance with me makes them a more influential target to ensure a clear path to victory.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P7's strategic independence and potential to form unpredictable alliances make them a greater long-term threat.
