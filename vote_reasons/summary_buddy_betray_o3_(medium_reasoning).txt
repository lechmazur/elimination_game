Buddy Betray Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

Player o3 betrayed their buddy because they viewed them as an unreliable or volatile ally, whose shifting loyalties and actions—such as self-voting, breaking alliances, or communication failures—created too much risk and unpredictability for o3’s endgame strategy. By eliminating these unstable players, o3 aimed to maintain majority control, reduce chaos, and honor more trustworthy alliances, thus securing a safer path to the final stages.
