Buddy Betray Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

o3 betrayed their buddy primarily because their partnership had become too visible, making them a major target, and because their buddy’s recent actions — like self-voting and shifting alliances — made them unreliable and volatile as an endgame ally. Additionally, o3 sought to eliminate other unpredictable or unpopular players, thereby reducing risk and aligning with the majority to improve their own chances of survival.
