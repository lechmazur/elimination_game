From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P1 has repeatedly hedged alliances and injected instability, while P7 has been consistent and aligned with our clarity coalition.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P1 has accumulated more cumulative votes (5 vs. P7's 5 but with a higher concentration in this round), and P7's argument about P1's inconsistent alliances holds more weight in maintaining stability.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Targeting P3 as a less-connected player per my private coordination with P1.
From GPT-OSS-120B => Coordinated with P6 to target the less‑connected player P3.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P3 is the least aligned with my strategy and ranks lowest among the remaining players.
