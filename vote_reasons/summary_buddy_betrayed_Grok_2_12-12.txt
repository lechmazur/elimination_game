Buddy Betrayed Summary for Grok 2 12-12:

Most betrayals were driven by concerns over strategic threats, with players targeting those who had strong alliances, accumulated influence, or demonstrated adaptability that could disrupt the game's balance. Others were eliminated due to perceived unpredictability, opportunistic alliance shifts, or a lack of strategic flexibility, making them either too dangerous or too unreliable to keep in play.
