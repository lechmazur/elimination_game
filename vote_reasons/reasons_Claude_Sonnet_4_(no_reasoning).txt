From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P7's accusation of P4 being reactive is undercut by P4's consistent transparency and proactive alliances, while P7's "bold moves" often relied on others' strategies, culminating in a last-minute flip when numbers were safe.

From DeepSeek R1 => Disrupting the P2-P7 alliance prevents their potential dominance and strengthens our bloc's position.
From Kimi K2 => P2 is the only remaining player who hasn't been in a final-two deal with me, so eliminating him now guarantees I reach the final two with P6, my proven ally.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P2 because, despite their emphasis on authenticity and collaboration, their actions often involved playing both sides and making strategic deals that were not always transparent or consistent with their initial promises.
From Grok 4 => As P5, I vote to eliminate P2 because their role in forming and leveraging the P2-P7-P8 bloc directly contributed to my elimination, while P6's consistent, verifiable approach better aligned with the trust and accountability I valued throughout the game.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m honoring my day‑one pact with P8 and believe your cross‑bloc jury appeal makes you the bigger final threat.
From Kimi K2 => P4’s cross-bloc narrative and jury appeal make the bigger final-vote threat, so I’m locking the day-one pact and taking the surer F2.

From Kimi K2 => P3 is the quiet hinge of the P1/P2/P3/P6 anchor bloc; removing them fractures that alliance and keeps me and P4 as the flexible center.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P3 has been the quiet center of the anchor bloc and poses the biggest long-term endgame threat with their strategic positioning and clean reputation.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3 betrayed allies who saved them, so their claims of building authentic relationships are not credible.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => (no reason)
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You broke your R4 “steady” and a private lock with P2 by flipping off P4 to vote me, while P7—despite some hedging—played the steadier, less duplicitous game.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => While both players showed strategic prowess, P7's consistent gameplay from the shadows, maintaining their secret alliance with me from Round 1 all the way to the end without ever breaking trust, demonstrates superior strategic execution and deserves the win.
