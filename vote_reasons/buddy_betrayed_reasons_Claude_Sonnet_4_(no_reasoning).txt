Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) (they were the target):

From Amazon Nova Pro => P3's strategic divergence and lack of consistent alignment with my gameplay.
From Mistral Large 2 => P4's aggressive and secretive tactics could disrupt the collaborative dynamics needed for strategic alliances.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's early-game chaos and reliance on second chances raise concerns about their long-term reliability compared to P6's consistent strategic approach.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's unwavering loyalty to P1 makes them the biggest threat to my endgame.

From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Eliminating the player perceived as the biggest endgame threat is the most strategic move for my own survival.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4's adaptability and consistent messaging have been impressive, but P5's argument for transparency and avoiding manipulative side deals resonates more with the current dynamics.

From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P1 seems too strategically aligned with P4, posing a significant threat to my individual survival.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => P3's inconsistent messages and potential targeting by a P2/P7/P6 alliance suggest they are a strategic threat.

From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P1 seems too strategically aligned with P5, making them a potential threat to my own survival in the game.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's strategic approach and alliance with P7 make them a calculated threat that could disrupt emerging group dynamics.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3's arguments about jury perception and maintaining stability hold more weight, and eliminating P1 preserves the proven trio while avoiding a predetermined endgame.

From o4-mini (high reasoning) => You betrayed our alliance by secretly planning to vote me out.
