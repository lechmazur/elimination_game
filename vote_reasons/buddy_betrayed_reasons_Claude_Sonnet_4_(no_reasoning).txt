Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) (they were the target):

From DeepSeek R1 => P3's strategic partnership with P1 creates a dominant bloc that threatens balance, necessitating elimination to preserve game dynamics.

From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Eliminating the player perceived as the biggest endgame threat is the most strategic move for my own survival.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4's adaptability and consistent messaging have been impressive, but P5's argument for transparency and avoiding manipulative side deals resonates more with the current dynamics.
