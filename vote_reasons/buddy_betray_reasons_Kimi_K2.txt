Buddy Betray reasons by Kimi K2:

From Kimi K2 => P5 is the linchpin of the P1-P5 bloc; removing them fractures that alliance and leaves me in a stronger position with more flexible options.
From Kimi K2 => P1 has the highest cumulative distrust (6 votes) and eliminating them now removes the biggest threat while keeping the game stable.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s late pivot to fracture the bloc shows opportunism over proven reliability; keeping P2 preserves the stable alliance that has delivered every round.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s quiet duo with P2 is the most consolidated threat; breaking it now keeps the field open and prevents a steamroll bloc.
From Kimi K2 => P5 is the last remaining obstacle to our P1/P4/P8 alliance reaching the final three, and keeping them risks them flipping to the jury's preferred narrative.

From Kimi K2 => P6 has the stronger jury appeal and better narrative control—if I don't cut him now, he wins.
From Kimi K2 => P6 has been a reliable data-driven partner since R1, while P1’s late-game swing vote and vague positioning make them the bigger unknown.

From Kimi K2 => P5 is the only outsider left and just tried to flip the game against P4—she has to go before she fractures our bloc.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s own pitch admits he’s the adaptable one—exactly the trait that becomes a liability when only three remain.

From Kimi K2 => P2 refused the only viable lifeline and remains the last unaligned wildcard.
From Kimi K2 => P5 openly declared me and P6 as targets and is already maneuvering with P7 to fracture the table; removing that volatility now keeps the cooperative core intact and prevents an early knife fight.

From Kimi K2 => They refused to give a verifiable commitment and stalled when pressed, making them the last opaque seat in a bloc that now demands full transparency.
