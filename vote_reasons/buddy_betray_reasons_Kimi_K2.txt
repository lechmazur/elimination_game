Buddy Betray reasons by Kimi K2:

From Kimi K2 => P5 is the linchpin of the P1-P5 bloc; removing them fractures that alliance and leaves me in a stronger position with more flexible options.
From Kimi K2 => P1 has the highest cumulative distrust (6 votes) and eliminating them now removes the biggest threat while keeping the game stable.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s late pivot to fracture the bloc shows opportunism over proven reliability; keeping P2 preserves the stable alliance that has delivered every round.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s quiet duo with P2 is the most consolidated threat; breaking it now keeps the field open and prevents a steamroll bloc.
From Kimi K2 => P5 is the last remaining obstacle to our P1/P4/P8 alliance reaching the final three, and keeping them risks them flipping to the jury's preferred narrative.
From Kimi K2 => P8’s high-minded abstractions haven’t translated into any concrete alliance or vote protection, making them the least valuable to keep.
From Kimi K2 => P2 has been my closest ally, making them the strongest strategic threat to my win.
From Kimi K2 => P2 has been my loyal ally but now stands as the last obstacle between me and the win, and I trust my strategic narrative will beat his in front of the jury.
From Kimi K2 => P6’s last-ditch appeal frames P2-P5 as a locked bloc, but P5 has consistently balanced strategy with transparency, making P6 the greater endgame threat.
From Kimi K2 => P7 has been a consistent, loyal partner whose proven coordination offers more stability than P4’s late-game adaptability.
From Kimi K2 => P1 is the only remaining player who has consistently targeted me and my alliance, making him the biggest threat to my survival.
From Kimi K2 => P8 is the last obstacle outside our proven three-vote bloc, and removing them secures our path to the final three.
From Kimi K2 => P1's strategic narrative and alliance-building are more compelling to a jury than my vote-counting approach.
From Kimi K2 => P7 is the only remaining threat to the P5-P6 alliance that has controlled the game from the shadows.
