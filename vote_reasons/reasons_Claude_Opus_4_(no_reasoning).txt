From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P7's unpredictability and stated 'calculated risks' make them the highest risk target to eliminate first.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P7 seems to be the most open to unconventional strategies, which might create unpredictability.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => P1 represents the greater strategic threat given their demonstrated alliance-building capabilities and would likely target me if they remained in the game.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Voting P1 to secure my spot in the final two with my ally P7.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P7's strong alliance with P4 makes them a bigger threat to my chances of reaching the final two compared to P4 alone.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => I vote to eliminate P7 because P4 demonstrated a stronger balance of strategic depth, adaptability, and fairness throughout the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7 demonstrated consistent authenticity and meaningful engagement, which aligns more closely with the principles of trust and collaboration emphasized in the game.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P5's statement accurately reflects the direct, alliance-driven game they played, whereas P8's claims of broad connection and P5's untrustworthiness are not well supported by the consistent P5/P8 partnership shown in the logs.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => I respect P5’s direct, transparent strategic game far more than P8’s consensus-driven approach.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P8 demonstrated a balanced approach of strategy and principle throughout the game.
