From Kimi K2 => P5 is the only one who explicitly committed to voting me out at 4, so I’m eliminating him first.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Eliminating P5 breaks the P5–P7 lock that would auto-target me at three, while P6 has kept every deal with me since R1.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You and P7 are locked F2 and targeting me; between you two, your flawless Day‑1 alliance is the bigger jury threat.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Repeated P1–P5 pairing plus hedgy “adaptability” makes P5 the highest-volatility risk, so removing P5 stabilizes the group.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5's calculated unpredictability threatens alliance stability and must be eliminated to secure our bloc's control.

From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => I maintain my original assessment that P3's calculated approach makes them a strategic threat, while P6 offers concrete cooperation to non-tied players.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3’s focus on connections over strategy makes them less aligned with the current need for decisive, coordinated action.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P3 is strategically isolated after P8's elimination and actively working to break up existing alliances, making them the biggest threat to my established partnerships.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Stability trim: P3 feels anti-coordination, is tightly linked with P2 this round, and likely cast one of the two R1 votes on me.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 has been inconsistent and poses a coordination risk, so eliminating them helps stabilize our alliance.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P3's emphasis on flexible partnerships and "nuanced strategy" risks destabilizing established alliances and could undermine our coordinated voting bloc.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3's approach seems unpredictable and less aligned with our strategic coordination.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted P7 out because they demonstrated reliability and trustworthiness, making them a strong and stable player, and eliminating them would remove a potentially powerful ally or future threat.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 repeatedly hedged and failed to commit or share vote history, making them an unreliable endgame partner.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P3 repeatedly hedged and withheld firm commitments/vote history (keeping P4 adjacency), while P1 has been transparent and reciprocal, so I’m eliminating the higher flip risk.
