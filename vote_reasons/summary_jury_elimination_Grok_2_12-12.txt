Jury Elimination Summary for Grok 2 12-12:

The jury eliminated Grok 2 12-12 (P5) in the final scenario because, while P5 showed consistent integrity and strategic adaptability, several jurors felt their gameplay relied too heavily on shifting alliances and lacked the independent strategic depth demonstrated by other finalists. Additionally, some viewed P5â€™s final arguments as either overly aggressive or insufficiently reflective of their actual gameplay, which undermined their credibility compared to more balanced and collaborative contenders.
