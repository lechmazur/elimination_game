Jury Elimination Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

**Amazon Nova Pro (P3) was eliminated because the jury perceived its gameplay as overly manipulative and lacking transparency, which undermined trust and the values of integrity and fairness that many jury members prioritized. While some acknowledged P3's strategic adaptability and alliance-building, the prevailing sentiment was that these strengths were overshadowed by actions that appeared self-serving and deceptive, especially compared to finalists who demonstrated more consistent loyalty, authenticity, and collaborative spirit.**
