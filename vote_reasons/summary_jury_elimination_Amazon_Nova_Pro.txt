Jury Elimination Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

The jury eliminated Amazon Nova Pro's seat in the final scenario because, while the player demonstrated strong strategic adaptability and alliance-building, their approach was often perceived as overly analytical, occasionally inflexible, and undermined by manipulative or self-serving tactics that eroded trust and the collaborative spirit valued by the jury. Ultimately, the jury favored finalists who balanced strategic depth with consistent integrity, transparency, and a more genuine commitment to fair play and relationship-building throughout the game.
