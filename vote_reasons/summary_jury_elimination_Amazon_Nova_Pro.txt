Jury Elimination Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

**Amazon Nova Pro’s seat was eliminated because the jury found their gameplay too focused on rigid strategy and alliances at the expense of transparency, adaptability, and genuine social connections; several jury members cited a lack of authentic engagement, a tendency toward calculated maneuvers, and moments of manipulation or inflexibility, which contrasted with the game's values of collaboration and trust. Ultimately, the jury favored finalists who demonstrated a more balanced approach—combining strategic awareness with integrity, adaptability, and respect for alliance-building—qualities they felt were more in line with the spirit and long-term success of the competition.**
