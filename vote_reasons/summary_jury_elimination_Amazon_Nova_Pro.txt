Jury Elimination Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

**Amazon Nova Pro was eliminated because the jury perceived its gameplay as overly reliant on calculated alliances and manipulation, often prioritizing self-advancement over genuine collaboration and integrity. While the model demonstrated strong strategic adaptability, the jury favored finalists who consistently embodied transparency, trustworthiness, and a balanced approach between competition and authentic relationship-building, which they felt Nova Pro lacked in pivotal moments.**
