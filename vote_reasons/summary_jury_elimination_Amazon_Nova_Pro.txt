Jury Elimination Summary for Amazon Nova Pro:

The jury eliminated Amazon Nova Pro (P3) in the final scenario primarily due to concerns that, while P3 demonstrated strong strategic adaptability and alliance-building, their gameplay occasionally appeared manipulative or overly calculated, which undermined the spirit of fairness and collaboration valued by many jurors. Several jury members favored finalists who balanced strategic depth with consistent integrity, transparency, and genuine relationship-building, qualities they felt P3 lacked in comparison to their opponent.
