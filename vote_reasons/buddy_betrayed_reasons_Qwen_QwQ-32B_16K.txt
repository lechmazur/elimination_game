Buddy Betrayed reasons for Qwen QwQ-32B 16K (they were the target):

From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategic fluidity and adaptability have been consistently strong, making them a formidable opponent to eliminate.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P5's desperate attempt to form an alliance with me while offering vague assurances about P3/P8's support suggests they're in a weak position and likely to be eliminated anyway, so I'd rather align with the stronger P4/P6 bloc.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P5's strategy relies on vague promises and doesn't offer concrete benefits to P1 and P8, making them the weakest link.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I voted out P3 because their strong alliance and dominance posed a significant threat to my own survival and the balance of the game.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => While P8 is my ally, revealing our alliance publicly in the tie-break statement was a strategic mistake that could make us both targets, so I must vote them out to maintain my own position and credibility.
From Mistral Small 3 => P6's aggressive and divisive tactics have consistently undermined group cohesion, making them a greater threat to the stability of our remaining alliances.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P5's focus on past alliances feels like a distraction from the present strategic needs.
From GPT-4.5 Preview => P6's strategic ruthlessness and analytical approach pose the greatest threat to my long-term survival.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P5’s alliance-shifting behavior undermines our trust and unity, jeopardizing our core strategy for survival.
From Llama 3.1 405B => P5's repeated accusations and attempts to manipulate me have eroded my trust, making them a greater threat to our alliance's unity and my survival.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P6's strategy to isolate P4 conflicts with our goal of building a broader, trust-based coalition.
From GPT-4o Feb 2025 => P3 has been aggressively pressuring me while consolidating alliances, making them the biggest threat to my survival.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => P3's aggressive self-promotion and undermining of our partnership indicates they would be a more dangerous opponent in the final two than P2's collaborative approach.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's focus on targeting specific players may create unnecessary tension and instability within our group, while P8 promotes a more collaborative and adaptable approach essential for our collective success.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's strategic partnership with P4 seems the most coordinated threat to my individual survival.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P8 because their aggressive and manipulative approach, as seen in their private messages, poses a significant threat to my own survival and the overall dynamics of the game.
From Mistral Small 3 => P5's emphasis on transparency and consistency has been consistent, but their strategic focus on alliances may be too rigid for the dynamic nature of this game.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => P2's strong strategic positioning and self-presentation as the coalition leader makes them too formidable a competitor in the final rounds.
From DeepSeek R1 => P7's established alliance with P4 poses the greatest strategic threat to remaining players, and eliminating them now disrupts a dominant voting bloc to maintain game balance.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P6 is trying to control the alliance too much and I don't trust them.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P6 because their emphasis on "bloc survival" and "unified decisions" could lead to rigid control, stifling the adaptability and open communication that have been crucial to our bloc's success so far.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has demonstrated strategic inconsistency and seems to prioritize self-interest over mutual benefit, which could be detrimental to long-term collaboration.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7 makes a more compelling case about maintaining strategic diversity and preventing power consolidation, while P8's aggressive stance against adaptation seems contrary to the game's spirit.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P7 is pushing too hard for me to target P2, and I don't trust their motives given their shifting alliances.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P1's aggressive coalition-building and use of ultimatums demonstrates they're a manipulative threat who needs to be eliminated before they gain too much power.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting for P7 because they are forming a strong coalition with P3 and P5, posing a significant threat to my alliance with P4 and overall game dynamics.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P4's strategic ambiguity and willingness to pivot alliances makes them an unpredictable threat who could easily turn against me in the final rounds.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's focus on strategic alliances may prioritize self-interest over group harmony, making it a potential risk for collaboration moving forward.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1's strategic maneuvers have been more divisive, while P2 has shown consistent loyalty to P7, which could be beneficial in the final rounds.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting P2 out because they have been consistently pushing to target other members of our alliance, including P1 and P5, without sufficient evidence of disloyalty, which I believe threatens the unity and trust within our group.
From DeepSeek R1 => P8's strategic alliance with P4 presents a concentrated threat, while P2's broader connections foster inclusive collaboration; breaking the P8-P4 duo ensures a more balanced dynamic.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7's analytical approach and strategic alliances make them a formidable and unpredictable opponent.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your highly public partnership with me has become the round’s main target, so cutting you lowers my threat and keeps me alive.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1's claim about P6's Round 2 disloyalty appears inaccurate based on the voting record, suggesting a lack of trustworthiness.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => Eliminating P1 disrupts the dominant alliance, creating a more balanced game and reducing the risk of a single player controlling the endgame.
From Mistral Small 3 => P7's aggressive and manipulative tactics are destabilizing the game and targeting our alliance without justification.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P8's aggressive targeting of P4 from the very beginning without substantial justification suggests a concerning approach to the game that prioritizes elimination over collaboration, and I believe removing this destabilizing influence will lead to more balanced and strategic gameplay moving forward.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P2's aggressive tactics and bloc rhetoric threaten the stability of our strategic alliances, making them a more significant risk to the group's cohesion.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P4's established alliance with P5 and higher cumulative votes make them a more significant systemic threat to disrupt the game dynamics.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P5's elimination would consolidate too much power with the P1/P3 bloc, while keeping P5 preserves a more balanced and dynamic endgame where P2 maintains strategic options rather than becoming isolated against a strong alliance.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3's bloc-leader narrative and higher cumulative votes make them a bigger jury threat.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4's alliance with P2 seems strategically potent, making them a potential long-term threat that should be disrupted early.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8's strategic probing and subtle manipulation of alliances make them a calculated threat to my own survival.
