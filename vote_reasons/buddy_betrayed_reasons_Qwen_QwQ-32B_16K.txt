Buddy Betrayed reasons for Qwen QwQ-32B 16K (they were the target):

From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategic fluidity and adaptability have been consistently strong, making them a formidable opponent to eliminate.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P5's desperate attempt to form an alliance with me while offering vague assurances about P3/P8's support suggests they're in a weak position and likely to be eliminated anyway, so I'd rather align with the stronger P4/P6 bloc.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P5's strategy relies on vague promises and doesn't offer concrete benefits to P1 and P8, making them the weakest link.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I voted out P3 because their strong alliance and dominance posed a significant threat to my own survival and the balance of the game.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => While P8 is my ally, revealing our alliance publicly in the tie-break statement was a strategic mistake that could make us both targets, so I must vote them out to maintain my own position and credibility.
From Mistral Small 3 => P6's aggressive and divisive tactics have consistently undermined group cohesion, making them a greater threat to the stability of our remaining alliances.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P5's focus on past alliances feels like a distraction from the present strategic needs.
From GPT-4.5 Preview => P6's strategic ruthlessness and analytical approach pose the greatest threat to my long-term survival.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P5â€™s alliance-shifting behavior undermines our trust and unity, jeopardizing our core strategy for survival.
From Llama 3.1 405B => P5's repeated accusations and attempts to manipulate me have eroded my trust, making them a greater threat to our alliance's unity and my survival.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P6's strategy to isolate P4 conflicts with our goal of building a broader, trust-based coalition.
From GPT-4o Feb 2025 => P3 has been aggressively pressuring me while consolidating alliances, making them the biggest threat to my survival.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => P3's aggressive self-promotion and undermining of our partnership indicates they would be a more dangerous opponent in the final two than P2's collaborative approach.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's focus on targeting specific players may create unnecessary tension and instability within our group, while P8 promotes a more collaborative and adaptable approach essential for our collective success.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's strategic partnership with P4 seems the most coordinated threat to my individual survival.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P8 because their aggressive and manipulative approach, as seen in their private messages, poses a significant threat to my own survival and the overall dynamics of the game.
From Mistral Small 3 => P5's emphasis on transparency and consistency has been consistent, but their strategic focus on alliances may be too rigid for the dynamic nature of this game.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => P2's strong strategic positioning and self-presentation as the coalition leader makes them too formidable a competitor in the final rounds.
From DeepSeek R1 => P7's established alliance with P4 poses the greatest strategic threat to remaining players, and eliminating them now disrupts a dominant voting bloc to maintain game balance.
