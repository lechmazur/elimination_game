From Kimi K2 => P4’s quiet consistency has become a liability—he’s the easiest consensus cut that keeps our core intact.

From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5's strong alliance with P8 and aggressive 'voting bloc' rhetoric pose the greatest strategic threat to our position and requires immediate neutralization.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => They're the strategic leader of the analytical bloc and targeting them will prevent a strong P5/P8 alliance from dominating the game.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting out P5 because their analytical and potentially confrontational approach is perceived as a significant threat, making them a target for elimination to maintain balance.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7 is the stronger half of the P2-P7 alliance and eliminating them disrupts that core.
From Kimi K2 => P7 is the strategic core of the P2-P7 pair; breaking it now isolates P2 and leaves me in the stronger final-three position with P4.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7 has been the most strategic and respected player throughout the game, making them unbeatable in a final two scenario.
From Kimi K2 => P7 has been the strategic mastermind and most consistent threat throughout the game, making them the biggest obstacle to my victory.

From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting for P3 because they have been too influential and pose a significant threat to my survival in the final rounds.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => He’s the jury-favorite swing king and if we don’t cut him now we all lose to him at Final 2.
From Grok 4 => P3's impressive jury résumé and control over the game make him the biggest threat to win, so eliminating him now aligns with P4's pact and boosts my odds in the final stages.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P2's straightforward approach and lack of private chats suggest they may be too trusting and less strategic, making them a lower priority to keep.

From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 consistently drove the strategy and decisive votes, while you largely rode shotgun, so I’m cutting the passenger and crowning the driver.
From Kimi K2 => P2’s claim of “integrity and transparency” rings hollow when the private logs show he repeatedly helped orchestrate blindsides while P5, despite the rhetoric, actually maintained steadier partnerships and took fewer direct shots at jury members.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P4’s statements were vague and noncommittal, signaling unreliable partnership potential.
From Kimi K2 => P4's "stability" rhetoric masks passivity and offers no concrete value, making them the safest consensus boot with minimal backlash.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => As P6, I've formed a clear alliance with P2 based on mutual trust and transparency. P5's aggressive tie-break statement attempts to undermine P2's credibility with misleading claims, positioning themselves as a "known quantity" while falsely framing P2 as ambiguous. Eliminating P5 removes a strategic manipulator who openly targets my ally, preserving the integrity of our collaboration. P4's analytical approach, while reserved, poses less immediate threat than P5's calculated aggression.

From Grok 4 => P6's quiet, analytical influence and likely partnership with P4 make them a significant long-term threat that needs to be addressed now to prevent them from controlling future votes.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P6 is the quiet influencer with the most dangerous long-term strategic threat profile who likely orchestrated the hidden coordination that eliminated P1.
