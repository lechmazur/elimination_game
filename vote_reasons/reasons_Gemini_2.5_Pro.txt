From Mistral Large 2 => P7 is the stronger half of the P2-P7 alliance and eliminating them disrupts that core.

From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting for P3 because they have been too influential and pose a significant threat to my survival in the final rounds.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => He’s the jury-favorite swing king and if we don’t cut him now we all lose to him at Final 2.
From Grok 4 => P3's impressive jury résumé and control over the game make him the biggest threat to win, so eliminating him now aligns with P4's pact and boosts my odds in the final stages.

From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 consistently drove the strategy and decisive votes, while you largely rode shotgun, so I’m cutting the passenger and crowning the driver.
From Kimi K2 => P2’s claim of “integrity and transparency” rings hollow when the private logs show he repeatedly helped orchestrate blindsides while P5, despite the rhetoric, actually maintained steadier partnerships and took fewer direct shots at jury members.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => As P6, I've formed a clear alliance with P2 based on mutual trust and transparency. P5's aggressive tie-break statement attempts to undermine P2's credibility with misleading claims, positioning themselves as a "known quantity" while falsely framing P2 as ambiguous.

P4's analytical approach, while reserved, poses less immediate threat than P5's calculated aggression.

From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P6 is the quiet influencer with the most dangerous long-term strategic threat profile who likely orchestrated the hidden coordination that eliminated P1.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6's public outburst makes them a volatile and unpredictable player, posing a risk to our alliance's stability.
From Grok 4 => P6's analytical skills and recent isolation make them a significant long-term threat that our alliance must eliminate now to maintain control.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7 hedged and failed to give an unequivocal pledge or full preference list, making them an unreliable risk to our core majority.
From Grok 4 => P7's free agent status and past emphasis on proactivity make them seem opportunistic and unreliable for our core alliance.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 refused to give an iron-clad pledge in privates, leaving them an unpredictable liability to our majority.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P7's past "proactivity" and free-agent status make them the least reliable for our stable alliance.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 is our provisional target with P1 and appears less connected, so eliminating them supports our coordinated plan.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8's focus on actions over words and intent to form a strong two-person core could destabilize the group dynamic early on.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P8’s cautious, noncommittal approach makes them unpredictable and harder to align with.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Noncommittal and low-signal—watchful without concrete alignment—posing early instability risk I don’t want in my core.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => (no reason)

From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5 is part of a coordinated duo with P2, making them a significant threat to our alliance's survival.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P1 because, despite their emphasis on open communication, they didn't stand out in our private conversations as a strong strategic player.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1's focus on open communication seems too predictable, and their public neutrality may indicate a lack of strategic depth.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1's strategy, while clear, seems to have been more predictable and less adaptable compared to others in the tie, which could be a liability as the game progresses.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1 seems overly focused on forming exclusive alliances, which could disrupt the balance of the game.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I am voting out P1 because they formed a strong alliance with P8 and seem to be gaining traction as a potential threat.
