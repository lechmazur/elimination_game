Buddy Betrayed reasons for o3 (medium reasoning) (they were the target):

From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1 has been the most consistent strategic threat and removing them ensures a clearer path to victory.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4 is a strategic threat who has been coordinating elimination moves, making them a dangerous opponent to keep in the game.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5's data-driven approach, while strategic, seems the most neutrally vulnerable in this group and could disrupt emerging alliance dynamics.
From DeepSeek R1 => P5's coordinated strategy to eliminate prominent players while operating covertly with P3 poses a greater long-term threat than overt collaborators like P6.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => I'm honoring my strategic partnership with P8 that we've built since Round 1, and I believe our authentic alliance gives me the best chance against the jury.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8 has openly admitted to earning enemies on the jury, which could significantly hinder their chances of winning against the remaining contestants.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P4 because they are making desperate promises and are the last remnant of a failed bloc, posing a threat to the stability of the remaining players.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4 has demonstrated strong analytical skills and game mastery, making them a significant jury threat.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P1's strategic maneuvering and jury threat outweigh P4's consistent alliance loyalty, making them the riskier player to retain in the endgame.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm honoring my Day-1 pact with P6 and won’t break core loyalty at the end.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P1 violated trust by breaking public no-vote terms last round and now offers opportunistic flip-flops that jeopardize alliance integrity.
From Mistral Large 2 => P5 has been the mastermind behind every strategic move, and eliminating them now ensures I have the best chance to win against P3 in the final jury vote.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => Given the revealed voting pattern and P2's insurmountable cumulative vote deficit in a potential tie, my vote must adapt to the new power dynamics to secure my path forward.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1 is the most strategic threat remaining and has been central to the dominant alliance.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You’re the biggest strategic/jury threat and, with P1+P6 likely aligned, this avoids a risky tie and best preserves my path.
From GPT-4o mini => P3's recent lack of transparency and the potential for them to disrupt the current alliances makes them a strategic target for elimination.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P4’s alliance with P7 creates a strong bloc that could dominate the remaining votes.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You’re the biggest endgame threat with cross-bloc ties and the highest cumulative heat, and without P3’s explicit pre-lock flip a 2-2 would likely eliminate you.
From Kimi K2 => P3 just attempted to blindside a loyal ally mid-tiebreak, proving volatility and high jury appeal—eliminate the bigger threat now.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P6 has survived multiple elimination attempts and would present the strongest underdog narrative to the jury in the finale.
From DeepSeek R1 => P5's admitted breach of trust in Round 4 and reliance on bribes make him a riskier ally than P3, who has consistently upheld agreements and offers clearer non-aggression terms to secure a stable Final 3.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P8 tried to manipulate me into betraying my day-one alliance with P5, showing they can't be trusted in the final moments.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating the biggest strategic threat to secure jury favor in the final.
From GLM-4.5 => P6 has relentlessly attempted to flip votes and fracture our alliance, proposing multiple betrayals and proving untrustworthy.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 is the biggest immediate threat to forming a stable, low-profile final three.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P8 has been the strategic mastermind behind multiple eliminations and poses the greatest threat to my endgame survival.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P5 and I built an ironclad partnership from round 3 that controlled the game's trajectory, and I'm honoring that commitment to the end.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => (no reason)
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P3 has already committed to taking P8 to finals, so voting P8 gives me the only path to survive if P3 honors his promise to vote me out.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 is actively trying to flip alliances and threatens our agreed F3 plan, so I'm voting to remove them.
