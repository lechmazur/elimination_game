Buddy Betrayed reasons for o3 (medium reasoning) (they were the target):

From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1 has been the most consistent strategic threat and removing them ensures a clearer path to victory.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4 is a strategic threat who has been coordinating elimination moves, making them a dangerous opponent to keep in the game.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P4 has been my consistent strategic partner throughout the entire game, and I must honor our alliance despite P1's tempting final-two offer.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5's data-driven approach, while strategic, seems the most neutrally vulnerable in this group and could disrupt emerging alliance dynamics.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P3 has been the strategic mastermind throughout the game, making them the biggest threat to win in the final 2.
