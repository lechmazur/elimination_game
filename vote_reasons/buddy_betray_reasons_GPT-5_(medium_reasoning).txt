Buddy Betray reasons by GPT-5 (medium reasoning):

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P1’s overreaching bloc-claims and volatility create unnecessary heat; removing them stabilizes the game and lowers variance.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P1 publicly targeted me and broke our Swerve-warning pact, making them my most immediate threat and likeliest endgame controller if not checked.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm locking the P3–P4–P8 final three, and your cumulative heat makes you the clean, consensus elimination.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m voting you as the only option consistent with my public locks, and your F2/F4 targets show misalignment and flip risk.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm honoring my Day-1 pact with P6 and won’t break core loyalty at the end.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You violated our top-2/no-vote deal and even tried to vote eliminated P7—too unreliable; safest elimination for stability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P2 gave a clear explanation and aligned cleanly with the core plan, while P1’s signaling has been shakier; keeping the steadier fifth preserves coalition unity.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7 broke our non‑target pact and leads in cumulative votes, making them the logical, principled elimination.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5’s connector posture threatens our coalition’s stability; removing them preserves our bloc’s control.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => At four, honoring my non‑aggression pact with P2 and P6 while avoiding a 2‑2 tie requires a clean, decisive vote on P8.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P2 couldn’t secure a flip, and I’m honoring my lock with P4/P5 to keep a clean majority and avoid a 2‑2 tiebreak that would send me home.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m honoring my F3 pact with P3 and P5 and avoiding a 2–2 coin flip.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You told me you’re voting me, and with my high cumulative votes I’d likely lose any tie—so my only safe path is a clean 2–1 on you.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => They suggested targeting a core seat (P2) and pushed a P6 vote despite our shield, showing misalignment and defection risk.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm preserving the P1–P4–P7 triangle, and you offered no verifiable receipts while making contradictory claims.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm honoring my public no‑vote pledges to P4 and P6 and prioritizing a stable trio with them, so you are my vote this round.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m honoring my public guardrails (P5/P8 non-targets, P2 final target) and removing the biggest endgame threat.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You refused any F2 pact, and as the more jury-favored half of the day-one duo, you’re my toughest finals matchup, so I’m breaking the pair.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You’re the biggest strategic/jury threat and, with P1+P6 likely aligned, this avoids a risky tie and best preserves my path.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Despite your late pivot, you remain the least integrated and most volatile after misreading R2, so eliminating you best preserves stability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Aligning with the consensus bloc for stability; P5 is isolated and the clean, low‑drama elimination.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P4 couldn’t produce proof of a viable counterplan and remains the highest-volatility threat to our coalition’s stability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => With higher cumulative votes P8 loses any tie and his pivot created this mess—keeping P4 preserves a clean majority and gives me the best F3 leverage.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You couldn’t deliver a verified trio with P3 or P8, and any 2–2 tie would eliminate you on cumulative votes, so this is the only stable move.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => At four, I'm locked no‑vote with P6 and P7, so I must vote the only remaining seat; strictly mechanics, not personal.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m honoring my stated lean and coordination with the core; P5 has the most heat/overlap and tried a last‑minute, unconfirmed pivot that undermined trust.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I gave P1 a final-three no-write pledge and will honor it, so my vote goes to you despite respecting your steady, loyal game.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Cleanest break: higher cumulative heat and inconsistent follow-through this round make P6 the less reliable partner to advance with.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Repeated reliability gaps and your targeting of P4 despite claiming to “reward reliability” make you the least trustworthy endgame partner.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m honoring my ironclad pact with P1, and P7 repeatedly tried to split us, so this is the clean, low-drama finish.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You’re the biggest endgame threat with cross-bloc ties and the highest cumulative heat, and without P3’s explicit pre-lock flip a 2-2 would likely eliminate you.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => To preserve balance and honor this round’s bridges, I’m eliminating P2; their 10 cumulative votes and swing-first play present greater F3 instability than P8.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You refused to flip and likely beat me at Final Two, so this is my only path.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 inflated alliances and re‑voted me in R3, while I’m locked with P3 since R1 and with P4 since R4.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Honoring my public pledge with P3/P8; removing you preserves our triangle and avoids unnecessary risk.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You’re the least-integrated/high-heat from R2, and this vote preserves bloc stability with P2/P3/P4/P8.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Eliminating P4 keeps my pledge to P2/S6 and avoids a 2–2 tie, providing a stable path to a clean F3.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You broke alignment in R3 and then offered vague, non-enforceable terms; the P2–P6–P7 trio is the more predictable path.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You're my toughest F2 matchup—your spotless, low‑drama résumé and likely jury support (especially P8) would probably get me cut.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m honoring the P4–P6–P8 pact; you proposed an F2 but didn’t secure the required public third-seat commitment, so I’m voting out the outside seat.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P2 and P4 are hard‑locked with me, and P5’s misreads (e.g., calling eliminated P3 a current threat) make coordination unreliable, so I’m voting for stability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Endgame requires precise reads and consistent execution; P4’s public misread about P7 and larger cumulative heat make them the riskier, less reliable option than P1.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7 has been the most opaque and cross-targeting player, a volatility risk at F4, while P1 and P3 enable a transparent, no-flip final three.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => A 2-2 tie would likely eliminate P7 on cumulative votes, so aligning with P6/P8 best preserves my path.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7 didn’t reciprocate shelter and, with the highest cumulative votes, is the safest tie-break target to break the P3–P7 duo without risking P1.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P3 reneged on our locked plan and created the 2-2-1 risk; I reward follow-through and cut unpredictability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Refused to provide R1–R4 receipts or a falsifiable R5 plan and targeted me in R4; accountability matters.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P2 is the last half of the dominant duo and is openly targeting me, so removing them prevents a forced endgame.
