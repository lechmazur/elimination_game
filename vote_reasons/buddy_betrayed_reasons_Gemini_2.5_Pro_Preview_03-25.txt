Buddy Betrayed reasons for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 (they were the target):

From Grok 2 12-12 => P4's isolation and recent votes against them make them a strategic target to eliminate a potential threat.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P6's strategy to disrupt alliances appears more threatening to the game's balance than P1's approach of maintaining broader, transparent relationships.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P5 voted against me in the tie-break last round despite our long-standing alliance, proving they're unpredictable and potentially disloyal in the final stretch.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6 is less likely to flip and more likely to maintain their alliance with P4.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 is the most unpredictable player remaining and could disrupt the planned P2/P3 alliance.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's approach to the endgame seems more opportunistic than strategic, and I believe P8 would be a more reliable final 2 partner given their consistent analytical gameplay throughout.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2 seems strategically cautious and could become a potential threat if they continue to build strategic connections.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I vote for P3 because their consistent strategy of dismantling strong pairs, including the successful targeting of P1 and attempted targeting of P4, demonstrates a clear and effective approach to the game that could pose a significant threat in the final rounds.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1 is the weakest link in the current alliance and poses the greatest threat to our unity.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P3 seems strategically dangerous and could potentially form alliances that threaten my position in the game.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P7 maintains our trio's unity and control, ensuring stability for the next phase.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5's strategic desperation and attempt to break up the P6/P3 alliance makes them a more unpredictable threat in the remaining stages of the game.
From DeepSeek-V3 => Maintaining unity within the alliance requires aligning on a common target, and P5 is the logical choice to ensure our group's cohesion.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P1's strong alliance with P5 throughout most of the game makes them a bigger threat to win the final jury vote compared to P5.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P3 seems more strategic and adaptable than P4, making them a greater threat in the final two.
From DeepSeek-V3 => Eliminating P7 aligns with the strategy to break the P1/P2 alliance and opens a clearer path to the final 3.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P2 because their strategic alignment with P8, while strong, has been perceived as a stable but potentially threatening duo to the remaining players, and removing them could provide a clearer path forward.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P4 is the most strategically astute player left, and eliminating them now gives me the best chance of winning.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => While P5 has been a loyal ally throughout the game, I believe P6 will be a more favorable opponent in the final jury vote due to their later entry into our alliance.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8 is the only remaining player outside our strong alliance, and their adaptability could pose a threat later.
From Mistral Small 3 => P1's strategic voting and potential to disrupt alliances make them a more immediate threat to the balance of the game.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4 seems less aligned with the current strategic dynamics and may pose a lower immediate threat.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P6 has demonstrated more consistent strategic value through their alliance with P3, while P2 appears more isolated after losing allies, making P2 the more logical elimination to maintain game stability.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P6's attempt to destabilize our alliance by trying to turn me against P1/P2 confirms they are the biggest threat to my current strategic position.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's survival of multiple elimination attempts and growing influence with P4 makes them a significant threat to my game.
From Mistral Small 3 => P6's unwavering loyalty to P4, despite strategic advantages of forming a new alliance, makes them a significant threat to my survival.
