From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Targeting a player allied with P5, whose unpredictable approach conflicts with my focus on trust and strategic alignment.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P7's approach of balancing caution with strategic collaboration aligns with our goals, but their emphasis on vigilance against hidden agendas raises concerns about potential unpredictability and instability in alliances.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P7's tie-break statement indicates they view my ally P2 as a threat and are actively working against our potential alliance.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P7 has been consistently targeted in previous rounds.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P7's neutrality and potential to disrupt our bloc's dominance make them the best candidate for elimination.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting out P7 because they are perceived as a threat to our forming alliance and are trying to disrupt our coalition.
