Buddy Betray reasons by Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K:

From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => Their bizarre template responses and inability to communicate authentically make them too unpredictable to work with.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => Your consistent, loyal gameplay would be too strong with the jury - I need to make the difficult choice that gives me the best chance to win.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P4's aggressive counter-alliance attempts threaten the stable core group I've been building since round 2.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P3 is actively trying to dismantle established alliances by approaching multiple players with conflicting proposals.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P8 refuses to commit to any voting plan despite my direct questions, showing the same evasive, purely transactional approach as P7.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => You betrayed my alliance partner P3 last round, and your social game makes you the bigger jury threat.
