From Llama 3.1 405B => I believe P3's gameplay was more strategic and dynamic, but P4's emphasis on honesty, cooperation, and integrity resonates more with me, and I feel that P3's actions, although effective, were more opportunistic and less aligned with the values I appreciate in this game.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I vote to eliminate P3 because they were accused by P4 of engineering multiple flips and hiding behind louder targets, which suggests a more opportunistic and less honest gameplay style.
