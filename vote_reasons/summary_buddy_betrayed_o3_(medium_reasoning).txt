Buddy Betrayed Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

Other players betrayed this seat primarily because it was seen as a major strategic threat due to behaviors such as consistently targeting others, forming alliances, and influencing the course of the game. Additionally, some players acted out of self-interest to improve their own chances in the endgame by removing a perceived strong competitor or following standard procedures for tie-breaks.
