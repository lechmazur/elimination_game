Buddy Betrayed Summary for o3 (medium reasoning):

Other players have often betrayed this seat because they view its occupant as a major strategic threat—either due to consistent gameplay, mastermind tactics, or influential alliance-building—which makes them dangerous to face in the endgame. In a few cases, betrayal was also motivated by alliance loyalty to others or the recognition that this seat's approach could destabilize new alliance structures.
