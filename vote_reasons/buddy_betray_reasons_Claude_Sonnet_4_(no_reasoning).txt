Buddy Betray reasons by Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning):

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 just tried to flip me against my closest ally P7, showing they're desperate and untrustworthy.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P7 has demonstrated strong strategic gameplay and alliance management throughout, making them a bigger threat in the endgame than P5, who has been more predictable and less adaptable.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4 has been the weakest strategic player, nearly eliminated multiple times and relying on recycled messaging rather than genuine adaptation.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4's repeated confusion about basic game facts and elimination order makes them an unreliable strategic partner for the endgame.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6 approached me seemingly interested in alliance but remained noncommittal and evasive, making them an unpredictable wildcard who could disrupt strategic plans.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => While P5 has been diplomatic with me personally, their unpredictable voting pattern (as P4 noted) and lack of clear alliance commitments make them the riskiest player to keep in the game at this critical juncture.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => My alliance with P1 has been my foundation since Round 1 and I must honor that loyalty in the finale.

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P8 has been my consistent target since Round 1 due to their unpredictable "bold moves" approach and the fact they keep receiving votes shows others share my concerns about their threat level.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4 is the strongest remaining player after making it deep with a powerful partnership, making them too dangerous to keep in the final rounds.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2's tie-break statement exposed our private alliance discussions publicly, which demonstrates they're willing to burn allies when desperate and makes them an untrustworthy partner going forward.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4's accusation about broken promises within their alliance is compelling, and P8's last-minute entry into our group makes them the least established ally compared to the more proven partnerships.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6 is the last player outside my core three-person alliance with P5 and P4, and eliminating them secures our path to the final three together.

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1's strong alliance with you represents the most coordinated threat remaining, and breaking up dominant partnerships has been a consistent strategy throughout this game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P7's analytical approach and pattern-spotting abilities make them the most dangerous long-term strategic threat, and their alliance with me has been too visible to the other players.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P5 is the only player without a solid alliance and poses the least threat to my endgame with P8 and P3.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P5's alliance switching throughout the game demonstrates opportunistic rather than strategic play, making them unreliable for endgame coordination.
