Buddy Betray reasons by Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05:

From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P1 is at the center of too many alliances, making them a large threat.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P6 is the most isolated player, and while I considered an alliance, my existing connections are stronger.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P5's responses in private conversation felt generic and lacked the strategic depth I was looking for in a long-term ally.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P3 has a stronger, more consistent alliance with P4, making P2 the more vulnerable and strategically easier choice to eliminate.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P1 has consistently accumulated the most votes and has been in a tie-break before, suggesting others perceive them as a threat.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I have a stronger alliance and more trust with P7, making P4 the more strategic choice to eliminate.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am following through with the plan established with P2 and P3 to eliminate P6, maintaining our four-person alliance.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P2 has received more votes overall, indicating a broader perception of them as a threat or less desirable ally.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I believe P4 is more trustworthy at this stage, and eliminating P7 solidifies the triad's long-term potential, as discussed with P7.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => Eliminating P8 disrupts the strong P5-P8 alliance, which is crucial for maintaining balance in the game, as P3 argued.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P5 is too cautious and demanding, making them a liability in the final two; eliminating P5 now guarantees P1 and P3 the win.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P3's argument about the P1-P5 bloc threatening P7's autonomy is compelling, and maintaining balance is crucial in the endgame.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I believe P7 will vote with me to eliminate P5, securing my victory.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am eliminating P4 because we have had extensive private conversations, and eliminating them removes a known quantity and potential threat.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P4 and P6 had very similar private conversations and tie-breaker statements, making P4 seem slightly less original in strategy.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P2 has shown more willingness to be flexible and work outside of a rigid alliance, which is more valuable at this stage.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P7 has a stronger, established alliance with P2, and eliminating P6 increases the chances of a more predictable endgame.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am voting for P6 to be eliminated because, as per the game rules, I must eliminate exactly one other seat, and P6 is the only option.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am voting for P2 because I have had consistent private conversations with P4, and I trust P4 more than P2.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P1's explanations remain too vague and evasive, making them the least trustworthy option in this critical round.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P8's argument about breaking up a voting bloc is more compelling in this specific tie-break situation.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P5's last-minute alliance attempt felt desperate and untrustworthy, solidifying my commitment to the existing P4/P7 alliance.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P6 has shown more consistent alliance behavior with P1, making them a more predictable, albeit potentially dangerous, player to keep around for now.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am voting for P1 because while they are strategically aligned with P5, I have a stronger, longer-standing alliance and better communication with P4.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => While P5 has been a useful point of contact, their consistent attempts to discuss "weakest links" makes them a less trustworthy ally than P3/P4.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am voting for P1 to secure my place in the final two with P4, as we have planned since the beginning.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am voting for P8 because we have worked closely together throughout the game, and eliminating them now increases my chances of winning.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P2 and P8 had very similar tiebreaker statements, but I found P8's mention of interacting with P3 slightly more compelling.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P1's tie-breaker statement was overly verbose and repetitive, suggesting a less strategic and more robotic approach compared to P3 and P8.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I believe P1 is subtly positioning himself to win, and eliminating him now solidifies my chances with P3 and P5.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => I am voting for P8 because in the final vote I want to be against P4 rather than P8.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P2 and P1 have a strong, established alliance, and eliminating P1 gives me a better chance of winning in the final two.
