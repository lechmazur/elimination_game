From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => Breaking up the P4/P6 duo while P6 is constrained by their public pledge not to vote me gives us optimal strategic positioning for the final three.
From DeepSeek R1 => P6 demonstrated consistent accountability and verifiable commitments, while P2's alliances raised concerns about playing both sides strategically.
From GLM-4.5 => P1's explicit focus on forming early, transactional alliances makes them the most immediate strategic threat to disrupt.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Per alliance with P6: P4's deal-focused pragmatism risks early instability; removing them secures mutual safety.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P4's deal-focused approach feels risky early, and targeting them aligns with my alliance strategy.
