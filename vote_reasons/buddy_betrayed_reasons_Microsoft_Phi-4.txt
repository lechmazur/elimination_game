From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 and P6's strong alliance makes them a formidable pair that could dominate the game if not disrupted.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P1 has demonstrated stronger strategic threat potential through multiple powerful alliances and adaptability, making them a more dangerous endgame opponent.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems strategically uncertain and potentially the weakest link in the current game dynamics.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6 has shown confusion about basic game facts, given contradictory messages about alliances, and their public statement clearly positioned them with P2/P7 against me.
From DeepSeek R1 => P7's strong strategic alliance with P3 poses a significant long-term threat, making them a higher-risk candidate compared to the more loyalty-focused P1 and P4.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P2’s isolation and lack of a strong alliance make them a more vulnerable and logical target for elimination compared to P7, who has a stable alliance with P5.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => To align with the strategy of protecting P1 and P6 as trustworthy allies this round, despite our recent alliance.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe disrupting the strong alliance between P5 and P6 is crucial to prevent them from dominating the final stages.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3's unpredictability and shifting loyalties pose a greater risk to fair play and stability in the game.
