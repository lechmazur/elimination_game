From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Concerned that P7's emphasis on "bold moves" signals a high-risk strategy that could destabilize alliances early.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6's early, conspicuous alliance-pitch makes them the most likely to form an early bloc and draw votes, so eliminating them reduces that risk.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => I suspect P6 is already in a strong alliance with P4, making them harder to influence and a bigger threat long-term.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P6 seems less protected by alliances and could be a safer elimination target.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted P6 out because they were too eager to form an alliance and potentially push a bloc, making them a visible target.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4 joined the discussion last, mostly echoed what others said without adding distinctive value, and I've coordinated with P1 to build trust through this aligned vote.
From Kimi K2 => I never connected with P4 in private, and a quiet seat with unknown alliances is a bigger threat than predictable ones.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P4's strategic adaptability and quiet coordination with P8 present an early risk.
From o1 (medium reasoning) => They played it too safe and mostly echoed others without adding their own distinct perspective.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Their public statement about "trust being a tool" suggests an opportunistic and self-serving playstyle that is a threat to building a reliable alliance.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P5's public statement about trust being a 'tool' was a major red flag, and their immediate pairing with P4 makes them the logical head of a potential counter-bloc.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => My initial assessment remains unchanged: P5's "trust is a tool" philosophy represents the most significant long-term risk to stable alliances.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4's stated preference for unpredictability and keeping others uncomfortable makes them a destabilizing force that threatens sustainable alliance-building.

From GPT-OSS-120B => Eliminating P7 removes the seat opposing our alliance and strengthens the reliable partnership I have with P8.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Honoring my pre-round commitment to eliminate P7; their tie-break misrepresentation signals a higher strategic threat than P8.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s claim of a unified bloc is contradicted by the 4-4 tie, while P8’s factual rebuttal and demonstrated reliability make the steadier keep.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Sticking to our plan—P7 is the larger strategic threat and just tried to misrepresent alliances.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P6's stated willingness to "make bold moves when necessary" combined with their partnership with the highly structured P4 creates a potentially dangerous power duo that needs to be disrupted early.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P6’s private alliance with P4 makes them too strong a threat.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P7's overly aggressive "cunning mind" posturing makes them an easy consensus target, and P3 and I have agreed to coordinate on this vote.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P7's public statement was the most overtly aggressive, marking them as an unpredictable and high-risk player who is likely to cause instability early on.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Their aggressive public statement made them an obvious and easy first target to build consensus against.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P7's aggressive stance poses a potential risk to our alliance strategy.

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => Their "trust is fleeting" philosophy signals they'll betray allies early, making them too dangerous to keep around.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P2's stated philosophy that "trust is fleeting" makes them the most volatile and unpredictable threat to stability in early rounds.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P2 has been the least aligned with our shared-foresight strategy and offers the weakest partnership value.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P2 appears to be forming a tight pair with P1, and they represent a strategic bloc outside of the collaborative group I am building with P5.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P8's self-described boldness and unpredictability make them a risky player to keep around, and I've aligned with P5 to vote them out as our strategic choice.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P8's emphasis on unpredictability and "bold moves" makes them a risky player to keep around, and I've coordinated with P3 who shares this assessment.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P8 appears to be forming a strong alliance with P3, which could pose a significant threat later in the game.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P1 and P6 confirmed a P1‑P8‑P6 trio and we coordinated to target P3.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Pre-agreed target with P8 and P6; P3 made no commitments to me and is my lowest-trust option.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => The P3-P4 pair is the most openly coordinated and aggressive bloc, and breaking them up is the best way to ensure stability for the next round.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I committed with P1 and P6 to target P3; eliminating P3 honors that pact and prevents the P3–P4 pairing from consolidating early power.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Breaking the P3-P4 alliance reduces consolidation risk, while P1's explicit non-aggression offer to non-tied seats provides immediate stability for the next round.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Our alliance has strategically selected P3 as the first elimination to establish a stable voting bloc and minimize unpredictability.
