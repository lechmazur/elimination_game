From Mistral Large 2 => P2's statement emphasizes integrity and respectful play, which aligns more closely with the values of fairness and collaboration.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => P2's accusations against P3 contradict what I observed, and their betrayal of our alliance in Round 5-6 reveals opportunistic gameplay that undermines their claims of integrity.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4 demonstrated superior strategic adaptability and genuine relationship-building throughout the game, while P1's accusation of "backstabbing" feels hypocritical given that P1 was part of the same trio alliance that systematically eliminated us.
From DeepSeek R1 => P4 demonstrated strategic adaptability without evident betrayal, while P1's accusations lack concrete evidence of deceit beyond standard gameplay.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P4 demonstrated consistent strategic adaptability and alliance-building, while P1's final statement relied on divisive rhetoric rather than showcasing their own gameplay merits.
