Jury Elimination Summary for Mistral Large 2:

**Mistral Large 2 - Jury's Reason for Elimination (Final Scenario):**

The jury eliminated this seat because, despite demonstrating adaptability and strategic engagement, their gameplay was perceived as lacking consistency in alliances and sometimes prioritizing personal gain or opportunistic moves over long-term trust and collaborative integrity. This approach led to concerns about reliability and alignment with the game's values of fairness, transparency, and genuine connection-building, making other finalists with steadier, more principled strategies preferable for the win.
