From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Locked on P2 with P7—removing P2 preserves our core alliance and honors the consensus we agreed to.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => While P4 played strategically well, their final statement's claim that P6 "relied on volatility and short-term maneuvers that fractured trust" contradicts what I observed - P6 actually maintained consistent partnerships and genuine engagement throughout, whereas P4's accusation itself seems like a last-minute manipulation tactic.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P3 remains outside the reciprocity-tested cohort and has given the least specific, swingy signaling, so I’m protecting stable collaborators.

From Gemini 2.5 Flash => I am honoring my pact with P8, my consistent partner, over your last-minute attempt to break our alliance.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P4 consistently honored his deals and took responsibility for his moves, whereas P7’s last‑minute flips eroded trust.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P7 demonstrated consistent adaptability and strategic survival through shifting alliances, while P4's rigid alliances and higher vote count suggested greater perceived threat and instability.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => While both of you voted to eliminate me, P4 played a more direct and accountable game by publicly declaring their strategy, whereas you benefited from their aggression while maintaining deniability.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P4 demonstrated more consistent strategic initiative and accountability, while P7's adaptability often relied on last-minute flips that eroded trust.
From GLM-4.5 => P7 demonstrated superior adaptability and relationship-building throughout the game, maintaining trust while navigating shifting alliances, whereas P4's rigid strategy often created instability and fractured trust.
From Kimi K2 => P5 has been the quiet conductor behind the P4/P7 echo chain and continues to steer narratives without ever offering original signal—eliminating the hub removes the last coordinated steering threat.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P5 continued echoing P7’s tone and strategy even after their elimination, confirming they were the last active coordination hub.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => Eliminating P7 disrupts the P5-P7 alignment and strengthens our core group of P1, P3, P4, and P6.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Eliminating P7 breaks the P5–P7 pairing and weakens a coordinated threat to our core.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Sticking with my prior plan to break the P5–P7 pairing and preserve the P1–P3–P4–P6 core for consistent, low‑chaos coordination.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => To follow through on my established alliance and coordinated strategy with P3, targeting P7 to break the P5-P7 pair and maintain stability.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => (no reason)
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P8’s messaging felt boilerplate and they never engaged me privately, making them my least reliable option for stable coordination.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 has been the most generic/low‑engagement player in public and private interactions and was our agreed initial target, so eliminating them follows our plan.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P8’s play has been the most generic and insular (primarily paired with P2), offering low information and matching my pre‑agreed target to remove the least substantive participant.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Evasive and boilerplate in PMs, leaning on a P2 pairing without concrete, falsifiable commitments, and failed my two-signal test—highest duplicity risk this round.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8's strategic focus on eliminating disruptors aligns too closely with the majority, making them less essential compared to others who bring unique perspectives.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 has been evasive in PMs and fits the copy‑paste/paired-with-P2 profile, so they're our logical target.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Jury math: P4 is the preferable F2 opponent, so eliminating them maximizes our win chances.
From Kimi K2 => P4’s final plea rings hollow—he claims integrity yet orchestrated the systematic elimination of nearly every juror, while P6 at least owned the game’s ruthless nature and delivered consistent strategic execution.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => P4 betrayed their long-time ally P5 in a similar opportunistic way that I was betrayed and eliminated, demonstrating inconsistency over integrity.

From GPT-OSS-120B => P6 has consistently honored coalition agreements and demonstrated strategic integrity, while P4’s later aggressive targeting and accusations reveal a less reliable gameplay.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 consistently executed the coalition’s strategy while P4’s play felt more inconsistent and reliant on luck, so I eliminate P4.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5 questioned my intentions and risked fracturing our bloc, so I don't trust them to stay aligned.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 publicly tried to wedge/blame over the P8 vote, signaling instability, and removing him secures the P1/P2/P3 Final 3.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => This vote is the execution of a pre-arranged plan with P1 and P2 to secure a Final 3 alliance.
From Grok 4 => P4's consistent opposition, including their tie-breaker vote against me and public calls to eliminate me, makes them the primary threat to my survival and alliance with P6.
From GPT-OSS-120B => Because P4 has shown opportunistic behavior and inconsistency, threatening our alliance and the game's fairness.
From Kimi K2 => P5’s signals stayed opaque, he never locked a vote path, and the bloc needed a clean target.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P5's lack of concrete receipts and clear voting commitment makes them the most unpredictable.

From Grok 4 => P1's vague public statement and apparent isolation make him an unpredictable element that could disrupt potential alliances later.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P1 seems too idealistic and rigid for long-term strategic flexibility, making them a risky ally.
From Grok 4 => Voting P1 to follow through on our alliance's coordinated plan to eliminate an exposed target and strengthen our core group.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => (no reason)
From GPT-OSS-120B => P1 is isolated and vague, making them a likely swing vote and threat.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P1 is the most entrenched and influential player in the core, and removing them weakens the existing power structure while improving my endgame odds.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P2 consistently honored alliances and avoided the opportunistic flips that made P1 a repeated target, so P2 deserves the win.
From Grok 4 => P1 directly betrayed me by promising alliance inclusion and a coordinated vote against P6, only to vote me out instead, which contradicts their claims of integrity and loyalty.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P2 consistently honored alliances and shared intel, while P1 broke trust multiple times despite claiming loyalty.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P1 because, despite both players having their strengths and weaknesses, P1's overall strategy and commitment to the group's goals were more aligned with the values of trust, consistency, and respect that this game emphasizes.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Voting P1 to weaken the tight P1/P3 pairing and disrupt their bloc.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe P1's tight alliance with P3 poses a greater long-term threat to game flexibility compared to P2's more adaptable approach.
From GLM-4.5 => Eliminating P1 weakens the established P1/P3 duo, creating more strategic flexibility for remaining players and aligning with my current partnership with P2 to disrupt rigid blocs.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe targeting P1 weakens the strong P1/P3 alliance, which poses a significant threat to our position.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => Eliminate the strong P1/P3 alliance to weaken their influence and disrupt their coordinated strategy.
From GLM-4.5 => P1 is the core of the P1/P3 alliance, and eliminating them disrupts a tight pair that poses a long-term threat to my survival.

From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => (no reason)
From GPT-OSS-120B => P7 is the biggest swing threat to our core alliance, so eliminating them strengthens our coordinated position.
From GLM-4.5 => P7's stated intent to disrupt P2/P4 threatens the stable alliance I'm building with P2/P4/P5, while P6's reliability and deal-honoring approach better supports my long-term strategy.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P6 offers more predictability and has a clear alliance path with P8, while P7 appears more disruptive and may destabilize early trust-building efforts.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P7’s swingy, unpredictable play threatens the stability of our coordinated core and makes them a bigger risk than the reliable P6.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P7 remains unpredictable after surviving the tie and hasn't clearly aligned with any core group, making them a destabilizing wildcard.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 is the consensus target this round and removing them is the safest, least-disruptive move for my alliance’s numbers.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P7 is the easiest target to lock in a majority vote based on our coalition's math.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P7 remained a potential swing risk in the final four, and eliminating them secures a stable, predictable path to the endgame.
From GLM-4.5 => P7's adaptability and potential wavering loyalty pose the greatest immediate risk to our bloc's stability and the clean path to final three we've carefully built with P3 and P2.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P1 and P3 insisted on eliminating P7 as our swing threat, so I'm locked into that vote.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe P1 demonstrated more proactive strategy and transparency throughout the game, which aligns with a leadership style I respect over P4's quieter, survival-focused approach.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P1 played a bold, transparent, and strategically accountable game, while P4 advanced more by avoiding risk than by leading.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P1 played openly, took responsibility for big moves, and was more accountable, while P4 tended to dodge targets and advance by leaning on others rather than taking the harder risks.
