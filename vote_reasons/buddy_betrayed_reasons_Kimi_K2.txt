Buddy Betrayed reasons for Kimi K2 (they were the target):

From Amazon Nova Pro => P8 has shown more adaptability and a stronger focus on building alliances, which seems crucial for navigating the game effectively.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting out P8 because they remain an unpredictable wildcard with no clear alliance, making them a potential threat in the final round.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has been actively forming a hidden alliance with P8, which undermines the transparency valued by the group.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P6 hasn't engaged publicly and may not be a reliable ally.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => This player was completely unresponsive in our private chat despite my repeated attempts to engage.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P6's secretive coordination with P5 creates an unchecked power dynamic that could manipulate outcomes long-term, making his removal critical to preserving balanced competition.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6's low-key, observant strategy suggests they might be strategically calculating and potentially less committed to building genuine alliances compared to the other tied players.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6's strategic flexibility and growing influence with multiple players makes them the biggest threat to my partnership with P2 reaching the final.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P5 tried to convince me to betray my loyal partner, proving they are untrustworthy and will do anything to survive.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => They confirmed their bloc is targeting me and refused to consider flipping without an impossible public vow.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7's analytical dominance and consistent strategic play makes them the stronger final two opponent compared to P5's passive survival strategy.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8's rigid partnership with P2 creates a predictable bloc, while eliminating them maintains strategic balance and flexibility for the remaining players.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => Aligning with P8 to break the dominant duo is the strategic move needed to secure my path to the final three.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's strategy, while effective, has relied heavily on manipulation and could be less sustainable in the final rounds compared to P1's consistent and trust-based approach.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Honoring our agreed F2 plan and maximizing my jury odds by sitting next to the less-threatening P8.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => While our alliance was effective, P1's purely ruthless approach lacks the strategic depth and principled gameplay that should win this game.
From GPT-4o mini => P6's cryptic approach and tendency to operate in shadows create an unpredictable environment, which could undermine strategic clarity and trust in the final rounds.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => While P1's analytical skills are valuable, their dismissive approach toward P7's empathy-based strategy and their focus on "controlling the narrative" suggests a more manipulative gameplay that could destabilize future alliances.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6's attempt to quietly orchestrate a bloc against P5/P4 makes them a strategic liability for my alliance.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 has been quietly coordinating eliminations and is a strategic threat due to their adaptability and low-key approach.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 has been quietly orchestrating eliminations and poses a strategic threat in the endgame.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P4 betrayed our final two agreement by making the same promise to P7, proving they are untrustworthy for the endgame.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5's adaptability and potential as a swing vote make them a destabilizing factor, and removing them ensures a more predictable and stable game progression.
From GLM-4.5 => P2's coercive tactics and ultimatums in private chats make them untrustworthy and destabilizing for balanced endgame negotiations.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8 and P3 are attempting to destabilize our bloc, so we need to neutralize their disruptive partnership before they can cause more chaos.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P7's attempts to disrupt the bloc have been unsuccessful, and their alignment with P6 threatens our strategic position and path to victory.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6 betrayed our alliance by voting P7 last round and has shown he's unreliable and willing to backstab partners when convenient.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P8 has been the strategic mastermind controlling the game since R4, and breaking our partnership now gives me the best chance to win the jury vote as the underdog who made the tough final move.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P1 represents the biggest remaining threat to my alliance's path to the final two.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P1's erratic ultimatums and shifting alliances make them the most unpredictable threat to stability.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You told me you’re voting me, and with my high cumulative votes I’d likely lose any tie—so my only safe path is a clean 2–1 on you.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P7's masterful under-the-radar gameplay and jury management make them too dangerous to face in finals.

From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2 is playing too aggressively and seems willing to eliminate allies who don't perfectly align with their narrow vision.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P3's tight bloc with P5 poses a strategic threat to the group's overall balance and could lead to premature consolidation of power.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I gave P1 a final-three no-write pledge and will honor it, so my vote goes to you despite respecting your steady, loyal game.
From Grok 4 => P7 is breaking our long-standing mutual protection pledge by refusing to vote out P5 and threatening to vote me instead, forcing me to eliminate him to avoid certain elimination and preserve my chance at final 2.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P8's unwavering loyalty to P5 makes them a predictable but uncontrollable bloc, and breaking it now secures a stronger path to the finals.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => As a free-agent who kept a vote on me last round, P3 now poses the greatest strategic threat and I pre-committed to target him.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's lower cumulative vote count suggests they are the less threatening player, and eliminating them ensures a more balanced final showdown with P7, who has demonstrated adaptability and strategic consistency.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P8 because they are building a potentially broader and more flexible alliance that could pose a significant threat if allowed to consolidate further.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P7 has accumulated more votes overall and has a history of swingy playstyle, making P5 the more stable choice.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5 has already accumulated more total votes and seems more strategically vulnerable, making them the most logical elimination target in this tie-break scenario.
From GPT-4o mini => P4's focus on information asymmetry and manipulation could pose a strategic threat to my game plan moving forward.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You're my toughest F2 matchup—your spotless, low‑drama résumé and likely jury support (especially P8) would probably get me cut.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P8's unpredictable nature and self-serving independence pose a greater risk in the endgame.

From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P1 attempted to break my core alliance with P7 and showed willingness to pivot on existing pacts, demonstrating unreliability.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P4 has been less collaborative and more focused on individual survival, making them a less valuable ally compared to P2, who has demonstrated strong partnership and strategic cooperation.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P8 claims coordination with me and multiple others which aligns with our private discussions, while P7 admits to staying uncommitted and gathering intel without participating in alliance-building.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 voted against me last round and just tried to flip me against P3, my most reliable ally since Round 1.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P2's consistent protection of P3 and refusal to pivot align with my strategic clarity and alliance priorities.
From Grok 4 => I am voting out P2 because he publicly led the charge against me, refused my private alliance offer to balance the game, and his rigid consistency makes him a dominant threat if I am eliminated.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P4 has been a consistent threat within the trio, and removing them now strengthens my position in the final three.
