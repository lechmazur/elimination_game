Buddy Betrayed reasons for Kimi K2 (they were the target):

From Amazon Nova Pro => P8 has shown more adaptability and a stronger focus on building alliances, which seems crucial for navigating the game effectively.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting out P8 because they remain an unpredictable wildcard with no clear alliance, making them a potential threat in the final round.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has been actively forming a hidden alliance with P8, which undermines the transparency valued by the group.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P6 hasn't engaged publicly and may not be a reliable ally.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => This player was completely unresponsive in our private chat despite my repeated attempts to engage.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P6's secretive coordination with P5 creates an unchecked power dynamic that could manipulate outcomes long-term, making his removal critical to preserving balanced competition.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6's low-key, observant strategy suggests they might be strategically calculating and potentially less committed to building genuine alliances compared to the other tied players.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6's strategic flexibility and growing influence with multiple players makes them the biggest threat to my partnership with P2 reaching the final.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P5 tried to convince me to betray my loyal partner, proving they are untrustworthy and will do anything to survive.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => They confirmed their bloc is targeting me and refused to consider flipping without an impossible public vow.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7's analytical dominance and consistent strategic play makes them the stronger final two opponent compared to P5's passive survival strategy.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's strategy, while effective, has relied heavily on manipulation and could be less sustainable in the final rounds compared to P1's consistent and trust-based approach.
From GPT-4o mini => P6's cryptic approach and tendency to operate in shadows create an unpredictable environment, which could undermine strategic clarity and trust in the final rounds.
