Buddy Betrayed Summary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K:

Other players who betrayed this seat typically cited two main reasons: either the seat was seen as a major **strategic threat**—due to strong alliances, consistent strategic gameplay, or influence over others—or the seat suffered from **technical/communication issues**, making collaboration, alliance-building, and reliable strategic planning impossible. In either case, eliminating these seats was justified as the logical move to advance individual chances of winning or to maintain game stability and alliance flexibility.
