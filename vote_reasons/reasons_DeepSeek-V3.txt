From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P5 remains the biggest hub-formation risk (broad outreach, name‑checking, prior P6 link), so removing P5 best preserves decentralized, predictable play.
From Kimi K2 => P5 is the last reactive player still scrambling to form loud, shifting alliances instead of steady, quiet partnerships.
