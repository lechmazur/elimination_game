From Mistral Medium 3 => P1 demonstrated a more consistent and strategic gameplay, while P8's approach relied more on emotional appeals and shifting alliances.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P3's close interactions with P5 might indicate a strong alliance that could challenge our position.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted P3 because they have been consistently forming strong alliances and are a potential threat if they align with the other remaining player against me.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P3's consistent focus on strategic foresight may pose a long-term threat.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your spotless vote record and close pairing with P1 make you the clearest jury and end-game threat.
From Mistral Large 2 => P4's strong jury connections make them a bigger threat in the final two.
From Kimi K2 => P4's game was more overtly strategic and alliance-driven, while P1's quieter, integrity-focused approach felt more genuine and less calculated.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your near-untouched path tells me you were shielded more than steering, so I’m rewarding P1’s transparency and greater exposure to risk.
From Mistral Large 2 => P1's consistent emphasis on loyalty and honesty throughout the game aligns more closely with the values expressed by the jury.
