Buddy Betray reasons by Mistral Medium 3:

From Mistral Medium 3 => P8's ambiguous and unpredictable gameplay poses a greater long-term threat in the endgame compared to P5's transparent and adaptable strategy.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P3's alliance with P1 has become too dominant, and breaking this bloc is necessary to restore balance and prevent further vote control.

From Mistral Medium 3 => P8 is isolated and pushing for a risky tie, while P2 and P7 have a stronger, more stable alliance.

From Mistral Medium 3 => P4's unpredictable and opportunistic gameplay poses a greater long-term threat to strategic stability, while P3 has demonstrated consistent adaptability and alliance reliability.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P2's cumulative vote history and strategic resilience make them a more significant long-term threat, despite P6's adaptability.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P3's strategic precision has been impressive, but their growing dominance with P1 risks consolidating power too visibly, and P4's adaptability offers more balance for the endgame.
