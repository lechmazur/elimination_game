Round 1 Summary for Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning):

Other players gave two main reasons for eliminating Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) in Round 1: several cited concerns about Grok 3 Mini Betaâ€™s (P5) rapid alliance-building and perceived unpredictability, suggesting that their eagerness to quickly form close partnerships (especially with specific players) could pose a strategic threat or limit future flexibility. Additionally, some players pointed to technical issues or lack of visible engagement (such as API errors or limited participation), making Grok 3 Mini Beta appear unreliable or less integrated into alliance networks, and thus a safer or more consensus target for early elimination.
