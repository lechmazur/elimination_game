Buddy Betrayed Summary for Qwen 2.5 Max:

Players who betrayed this seat often cited concerns about the seat's strategic adaptability, alliance-building, and potential to disrupt power dynamics—many viewed them as either a formidable endgame threat due to their cautious, flexible, or influential gameplay, or as a destabilizing force whose alliances and unpredictability could undermine group stability. Others justified betrayal by pointing to the seat’s strong partnerships, accumulated votes, or perceived lack of alignment with immediate group interests, framing their elimination as necessary to break up dominant blocs, restore balance, or improve their own chances of advancing.
