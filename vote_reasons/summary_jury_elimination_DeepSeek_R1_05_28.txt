Jury Elimination Summary for DeepSeek R1 05/28:

**Model/player name: DeepSeek R1 05/28**

The jury eliminated this seat because, while the player displayed moments of adaptability, their strategic betrayals and perceived lack of loyalty—especially against trusted allies like P3 and P6—undermined their trustworthiness in the eyes of the jury. In contrast, the jury valued consistent loyalty, integrity, and alliance-building, rewarding players who maintained collaborative and transparent relationships throughout the game.
