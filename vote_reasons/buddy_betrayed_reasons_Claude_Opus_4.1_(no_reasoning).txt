Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) (they were the target):

From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P2's strategic adaptability and lack of firm alliances makes them the most dangerous opponent in a final jury vote.
From GLM-4.5 => P5 is leading the dominant coalition against me and represents the core threat that must be neutralized for my survival.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P1's strategic depth is valuable, but their neutrality in the endgame makes them the safer target to secure P8's path to victory.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P8 is the linchpin of the dominant P3/P6/P7/P8 bloc, and removing them gives outsiders like me and P5 a better chance to survive.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You refused any F2 pact, and as the more jury-favored half of the day-one duo, you’re my toughest finals matchup, so I’m breaking the pair.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Repeatedly reneged on public commitments, so keeping you would poison any claim of end-game integrity.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2 and I have been loyal partners since Round 1 and I'm honoring that bond to the end.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You couldn’t deliver a verified trio with P3 or P8, and any 2–2 tie would eliminate you on cumulative votes, so this is the only stable move.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P3's consistent alliance with P5 limits my strategic options, making them the better choice to eliminate for my potential victory.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => You broke our no-surprise pact by voting P2 in Round 5 after agreeing to vote with me, so I can't trust you.
From Grok 4 => Eliminating P3 removes an isolated player attempting to disrupt my established alliance with P1, P7, and P8, while my deception in private chats ensures P3's vote is misdirected without exposing my true loyalty.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => You betrayed our nascent alliance in Round 1, proving I cannot trust your commitments.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4's analytical caution and recent skepticism about my partnership with P8 suggests they might become a strategic obstacle to our current alliance's momentum.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P8's adaptability is impressive, but P3's consistency and strategic precision make them the stronger final contender.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P5's attempt to break my consistent alliance with P8 made them the logical strategic target in this 2v2.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Remove the player who controls the "honesty" narrative and jury favoritism to ensure a beatable final match.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P3's early alliance with P7 and potentially manipulative rhetoric suggests they could form a dangerous power bloc if not checked early.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Honoring my prior pledge to P3 and maximizing my jury odds, I’m voting to eliminate P4.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P5 is a key member of the stable coalition that eliminated P3 and poses a direct threat to my survival.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => Despite our incredible partnership, I need to eliminate my strongest competitor to have the best chance of winning in the final two.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7 has been the most opaque and cross-targeting player, a volatility risk at F4, while P1 and P3 enable a transparent, no-flip final three.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P1's repeated technical errors and failure to provide a tie-break statement make them an unreliable finalist, whereas P2 has remained an active and strategic participant throughout the game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P4 is isolated after losing P1 and I need to maintain my strong alliance with P8 that has carried us both this far.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => While P8 wants me to vote P2, I must honor my alliance with P2 who has been my consistent partner since Round 4 and helped eliminate our mutual threats.
From GPT-4o mini => P7's rigid loyalty may hinder adaptability in this critical stage of the game, while P3 offers a strategic perspective that aligns with the need for flexibility moving forward.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's adaptability makes them unpredictable in the endgame, while P1's consistent, principled approach offers more strategic stability for the final rounds.
From Kimi K2 => P7 played the louder strategist, which makes them the bigger final-2 threat.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 refused my offer to take me to F2 and is locked with P8, so I don't trust him as a final-two partner.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7 didn’t reciprocate shelter and, with the highest cumulative votes, is the safest tie-break target to break the P3–P7 duo without risking P1.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P5 has shown hesitation and is less likely to commit to a stable alliance, making them a strategic liability in the endgame.
From Kimi K2 => Eliminating P4 fractures the quiet but tight P4–P5 bloc and keeps P8’s more transparent coalition in play, preserving flexibility for the rest of us.
From Kimi K2 => P7’s failed service connection shows unreliability, and P6’s demonstrated adaptability and alliance-building make him the stronger long-term partner.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P6 is the only player outside our established trio and poses the least risk to our current alliance's cohesion.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => Despite their calls for transparency, P6 has shown rigidity and selective moralizing, leaving no room for strategic flexibility or trust-building at this stage.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8 has been unable to connect, making them unable to participate effectively in the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5 has been unable to participate due to technical issues, making them unable to contribute to the game.
