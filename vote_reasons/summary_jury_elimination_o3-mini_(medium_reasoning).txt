Jury Elimination Summary for o3-mini (medium reasoning):

The jury eliminated P8 because they perceived their gameplay as less consistent in trust-building and alliance maintenance compared to their opponent, who demonstrated a more transparent and collaborative approach. While P8 showed strategic insight, many jury members felt their emphasis on trust was less genuine, and their adaptability sometimes came at the cost of long-term relationships, making their opponent the more deserving finalist.
