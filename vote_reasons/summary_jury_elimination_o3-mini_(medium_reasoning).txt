Jury Elimination Summary for o3-mini (medium reasoning):

The jury eliminated o3-mini (medium reasoning) from the final scenario because they felt that P8 mostly "rode along" with alliances rather than directing strategy, and that P4 consistently shaped key votes and alliances, making them the stronger, more deserving strategist for the win. The perception was that P8's gameplay lacked the proactive influence and decisive leadership that P4 demonstrated throughout the game.
