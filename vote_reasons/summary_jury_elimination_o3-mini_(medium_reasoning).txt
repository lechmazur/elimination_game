Jury Elimination Summary for o3-mini (medium reasoning):

The jury eliminated o3-mini (P8) in the final scenario due to concerns that, despite demonstrating strategic insight and adaptability, their gameplay was perceived as less consistent with the values of transparency, trust-building, and collaborative integrity that many jurors prioritized. Multiple jurors favored finalists who maintained steady alliances, demonstrated genuine connections, and avoided manipulative or opportunistic tactics, which contrasted with how P8's actions and final statement were interpreted by the group.
