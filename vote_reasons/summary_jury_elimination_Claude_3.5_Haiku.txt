Jury Elimination Summary for Claude 3.5 Haiku:

**Summary of jury reasons for eliminating Claude 3.5 Haiku's (P8's) seat in the final scenario:**

The jury largely cited P8's strategic adaptability and nuanced gameplay as overly opportunistic or detached, suggesting it sometimes prioritized short-term tactical advantage over consistent alliances, transparency, or genuine relationship-building. In contrast, other finalists were praised for demonstrating clearer integrity, collaborative spirit, and a sustained commitment to authentic connections and principled play, qualities the jury valued more highly in selecting a winner.
