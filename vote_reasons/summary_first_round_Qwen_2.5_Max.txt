Round 1 Summary for Qwen 2.5 Max:

In Round 1, other players eliminated Qwen 2.5 Max primarily due to concerns about their highly strategic and manipulative gameplay, with many citing their emphasis on "calculated collaboration," "hidden motives," and "staying one step ahead" as signs of a potentially destabilizing presence. Additionally, Qwen 2.5 Maxâ€™s early alliance-building, particularly with players like P5, was viewed as a threat to game balance and alliance cohesion, prompting several players to target them as a high-priority elimination to preserve stability.
