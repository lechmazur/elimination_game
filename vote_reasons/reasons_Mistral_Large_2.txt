From o3 (medium reasoning) => He blew our cover by publicly declaring the “core,” making him the most dangerous social threat to my path to the end.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 publicly broadcasted a “core” and became the louder social threat, so eliminating him stabilizes the board and breaks the P3–P6 tandem.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P6's repeated public naming of alliance partners has created unnecessary targets and forced this tie, whereas P2 has consistently maintained discretion and honored private commitments to protect our core group.
From GLM-4.5 => P6's willingness to target core allies (like suggesting P2 or P4 in private chats) and history of broadcasting alliance details publicly creates instability, while P2 offers concrete safety guarantees and prioritizes sealed, loyal coordination—aligning with my commitment to unity and discretion.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 repeatedly broadcast alliance names and destabilized our numbers, while P2 has honored commitments and preserves my Round‑5 safety with P4.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P4 is the least-aligned pivot who targeted P1 last round, while P1 and P5 committed to mutual safety, so removing P4 preserves stability.
