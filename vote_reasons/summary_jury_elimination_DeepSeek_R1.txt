Jury Elimination Summary for DeepSeek R1:

In the final scenario, DeepSeek R1 was eliminated because the jury consistently viewed other finalists as demonstrating superior adaptability, proactive strategy, and more authentic alliance-building. While DeepSeek R1 showed moments of strategic play, jurors cited a pattern of relying on alliances without driving key moves, a more passive approach compared to their opponentâ€™s active leadership and decision-making, and a lack of distinctive or influential gameplay that could match the initiative, transparency, and resilience they valued in the eventual winner.
