Jury Elimination Summary for DeepSeek R1:

**DeepSeek R1's seat was eliminated by the jury for displaying inconsistent alliance-building and perceived self-serving or opportunistic gameplay, which at times undermined trust and failed to embody the collaborative and transparent spirit valued by the jury. Jurors favored finalists who demonstrated consistent integrity, adaptability, genuine connections, and a balance between strategic foresight and respect for alliances, which they felt DeepSeek R1's approach did not fully achieve.**
