Players betrayed this seat for various strategic reasons, including concerns about strong alliances (e.g., P2's alliance with P1 and P5, P4's alliance with P6 and P7) and fears of adaptability or shifting loyalties (e.g., P1's cautious approach, P8's counter-strategizing). Others targeted opponents who posed direct threats to their endgame plans, such as P3's strategizing against them or P5's emerging alliance with P7.
