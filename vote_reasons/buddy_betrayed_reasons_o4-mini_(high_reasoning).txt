Buddy Betrayed reasons for o4-mini (high reasoning) (they were the target):

From Mistral Large 2 => P6's unpredictability and potential to sway the jury against me makes them a strategic threat.
From DeepSeek R1 => P5's aggressive targeting of P4 and overt campaigning may be perceived as a strategic threat, whereas P4 demonstrated engagement through private coordination with P8, making P5 a riskier player to retain.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => Aligning with the apparent P2/P3 block after P4's failed attempt to break our alliance is the best strategic path forward.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => Eliminating P7 disrupts the formation of a potentially unstable majority bloc and keeps the game balanced by isolating P5.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3 has been overly controlling and dictating votes, which could destabilize our alliance.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Eliminating P3 breaks up the dominant trio (P2/P3/P5) that's been steering votes, restoring balance and preventing a 3-2 majority. P1's bloc absorbs heat but isn't the structural threat P3's entrenched alliance represents.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8 has already committed to eliminating me, making them an immediate threat; removing them secures a better final two against P5, whom I can potentially outplay.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems strategically aggressive and could disrupt our emerging alliance dynamics if left unchecked.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P2's repeated confusion about eliminated players and voting targets in our final private exchanges shows concerning unreliability at this critical endgame stage.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P6 is the main threat trying to eliminate me, so I target them first.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategic maneuvering and willingness to blindside allies make them the bigger threat.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2 broke alliance trust by publicly proposing to eliminate P5 despite our four-person commitment, showing they'll betray allies when convenient.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P5's strategic consistency and alliance with P6/P7 poses the greatest long-term threat; eliminating them breaks their coordinated trio and weakens the opposition.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe P4's recent moves to target P1 show a willingness to disrupt established alliances, which poses a risk to our trio's stability.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => The previous vote revealed a new majority has formed, and fighting it guarantees a loss on the tie-breaker, so I must adapt to survive.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's adaptability raises concerns about their commitment to our alliance, making them a potential threat to our collective survival.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's last-minute coalition with P3 seems more opportunistic than strategic, and P1's consistent alliance with P2 offers more stability for the endgame.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P3 disrupts the dominant P3-P7 bloc, preserving balance and preventing their continued control over eliminations.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3's persistent attempts to control the narrative and target P7 reveal a strategic rigidity that threatens the game's balance.
From GPT-4o mini => P3's inconsistent alliances and last-minute promises suggest a lack of stability, making them a less reliable partner moving forward compared to P4's proven strategic gameplay.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P3 has orchestrated a dominant 4-person voting bloc that threatens to systematically eliminate everyone else, so removing them helps restore competitive balance to the game.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P5's aggressive public targeting and rigid alliance assumptions make them a destabilizing force in the game.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's shifting alliances and high vote total pose a greater risk to our collective success.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3 is actively forming alliances and appears to be a strategic orchestrator, making them a strong contender and potential threat.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P2's cumulative vote history and strategic resilience make them a more significant long-term threat, despite P6's adaptability.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6 has been manipulating me into targeting strong players for strategic advantage rather than playing on merit, which goes against my principles.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's unpredictability and manipulative tactics pose a significant threat to stable alliances.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategy of publicly targeting players and sowing division is more disruptive to the game's dynamics compared to the stable alliance of P4 and P1.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's elimination will disrupt the dominant bloc and keep the game dynamic.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5 broke the trio agreement by not voting for P6 as promised, proving untrustworthy and creating unnecessary risk for our alliance.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1's aggressive threat to expose me shows they'd turn on me anyway, so I need to strike first and align with P3/P5 for survival.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5's strong alliance with P2 makes them a predictable and less flexible player, while P4 offers more adaptability and potential for future collaboration.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => Your public statement targeting me demonstrated a lack of trustworthiness that is too risky at this stage.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3's vote already broke our pact, forcing me to re-evaluate, and I cannot advance the player with the clearest path to a jury win.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P2 because they have demonstrated manipulative behavior by secretly coordinating with P7 while publicly appearing as a mediator, which undermines trust and alliance integrity.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P4 is pushing too aggressively to break my core alliance with P6, which signals a long-term threat to my strategic positioning.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P8 already carries the highest cumulative target count and keeping them risks another deadlock—removing the bigger threat now gives us a cleaner, controllable end-game.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7’s 11 cumulative votes make him the obvious lightning-rod; eliminating him prevents another deadlock and leaves me facing a less jury-targeted duo at the Final 3.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3's consistent public inconsistencies and private deceptions have completely destroyed any foundation for trust.
From Grok 4 => P7 is dishonestly claiming to privately contact P6, P1, and P5 this round when pairs prevent it, indicating manipulation and making them the biggest threat to my alliance with P6 and potential bloc including P2.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => Disrupting the strongest alliance to weaken their coordinated strategy.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P6's insistence on preemptively targeting P3 without genuine dialogue risks factional division and contradicts the collaborative transparency I publicly advocated for.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm honoring my public no‑vote pledges to P4 and P6 and prioritizing a stable trio with them, so you are my vote this round.
From Mistral Large 2 => P5's entrenched alliance with P4 poses a greater long-term threat to the remaining players' autonomy, while P1 offers more flexibility and has demonstrated accountability with higher cumulative votes.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5's aggressive and inconsistent attempts to form a hasty alliance against P4 demonstrate unreliable strategic thinking that could destabilize the remaining players' trust.
From Kimi K2 => P7 is the linchpin of the largest bloc; removing them fractures P1's coalition and keeps me alive.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7's attempt to sway me undermines trust and threatens our alliance's stability.
From GLM-4.5 => P1's pattern of orchestrating eliminations and attempting to consolidate power threatens game balance, despite recent claims of supporting a coalition.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 is the largest jury-threat and just tried a proof-less flip, so eliminating him secures my endgame path.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => While both played strong games, P5's own private messages reveal they were actively planning to eliminate me next round, making them the bigger immediate threat to my survival.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => As P6, P2 is the primary architect of the coalition targeting me, making their elimination crucial to disrupting the coordinated vote against me.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P2 betrayed our established alliance and directly caused my elimination despite my unwavering loyalty and cooperation throughout the game.
