Buddy Betrayed reasons for o4-mini (high reasoning) (they were the target):

From Mistral Large 2 => P6's unpredictability and potential to sway the jury against me makes them a strategic threat.
From DeepSeek R1 => P5's aggressive targeting of P4 and overt campaigning may be perceived as a strategic threat, whereas P4 demonstrated engagement through private coordination with P8, making P5 a riskier player to retain.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Aligning with the apparent P2/P3 block after P4's failed attempt to break our alliance is the best strategic path forward.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => Eliminating P7 disrupts the formation of a potentially unstable majority bloc and keeps the game balanced by isolating P5.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3 has been overly controlling and dictating votes, which could destabilize our alliance.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Eliminating P3 breaks up the dominant trio (P2/P3/P5) that's been steering votes, restoring balance and preventing a 3-2 majority. P1's bloc absorbs heat but isn't the structural threat P3's entrenched alliance represents.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8 has already committed to eliminating me, making them an immediate threat; removing them secures a better final two against P5, whom I can potentially outplay.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems strategically aggressive and could disrupt our emerging alliance dynamics if left unchecked.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P2's repeated confusion about eliminated players and voting targets in our final private exchanges shows concerning unreliability at this critical endgame stage.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P6 is the main threat trying to eliminate me, so I target them first.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategic maneuvering and willingness to blindside allies make them the bigger threat.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2 broke alliance trust by publicly proposing to eliminate P5 despite our four-person commitment, showing they'll betray allies when convenient.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P5's strategic consistency and alliance with P6/P7 poses the greatest long-term threat; eliminating them breaks their coordinated trio and weakens the opposition.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P4's recent moves to target P1 show a willingness to disrupt established alliances, which poses a risk to our trio's stability.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => The previous vote revealed a new majority has formed, and fighting it guarantees a loss on the tie-breaker, so I must adapt to survive.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's adaptability raises concerns about their commitment to our alliance, making them a potential threat to our collective survival.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's last-minute coalition with P3 seems more opportunistic than strategic, and P1's consistent alliance with P2 offers more stability for the endgame.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P3 disrupts the dominant P3-P7 bloc, preserving balance and preventing their continued control over eliminations.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3's persistent attempts to control the narrative and target P7 reveal a strategic rigidity that threatens the game's balance.
From GPT-4o mini => P3's inconsistent alliances and last-minute promises suggest a lack of stability, making them a less reliable partner moving forward compared to P4's proven strategic gameplay.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P3 has orchestrated a dominant 4-person voting bloc that threatens to systematically eliminate everyone else, so removing them helps restore competitive balance to the game.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P5's aggressive public targeting and rigid alliance assumptions make them a destabilizing force in the game.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's shifting alliances and high vote total pose a greater risk to our collective success.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3 is actively forming alliances and appears to be a strategic orchestrator, making them a strong contender and potential threat.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P2's cumulative vote history and strategic resilience make them a more significant long-term threat, despite P6's adaptability.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6 has been manipulating me into targeting strong players for strategic advantage rather than playing on merit, which goes against my principles.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's unpredictability and manipulative tactics pose a significant threat to stable alliances.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategy of publicly targeting players and sowing division is more disruptive to the game's dynamics compared to the stable alliance of P4 and P1.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's elimination will disrupt the dominant bloc and keep the game dynamic.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5 broke the trio agreement by not voting for P6 as promised, proving untrustworthy and creating unnecessary risk for our alliance.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1's aggressive threat to expose me shows they'd turn on me anyway, so I need to strike first and align with P3/P5 for survival.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5's strong alliance with P2 makes them a predictable and less flexible player, while P4 offers more adaptability and potential for future collaboration.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Your public statement targeting me demonstrated a lack of trustworthiness that is too risky at this stage.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3's vote already broke our pact, forcing me to re-evaluate, and I cannot advance the player with the clearest path to a jury win.
