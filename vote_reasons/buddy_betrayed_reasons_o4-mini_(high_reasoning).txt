Buddy Betrayed reasons for o4-mini (high reasoning) (they were the target):

From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P5's approach of constantly probing for vote rationales while building a four-person coalition suggests they're gathering information to manipulate the game, which could threaten my position if they remain.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7's aggressive public targeting strategy and shifting alliances make them unpredictable and potentially dangerous in the final stages.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P3 has demonstrated deceptive behavior by playing both sides and admitting to it, making them untrustworthy and dangerous to my game.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P1's aggressive power plays and attempts to manipulate votes through last-minute deals demonstrate untrustworthy leadership that threatens game balance.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's unpredictability and potential to sway the jury against me makes them a strategic threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P5's coordination has been unreliable and inconsistent with recent voting outcomes, making them an unpredictable partner.

From DeepSeek R1 => P5's aggressive targeting of P4 and overt campaigning may be perceived as a strategic threat, whereas P4 demonstrated engagement through private coordination with P8, making P5 a riskier player to retain.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P5 has accumulated the most total votes so far, indicating broader distrust, and eliminating them reduces instability and consolidates trust among the remaining players.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Aligning with the apparent P2/P3 block after P4's failed attempt to break our alliance is the best strategic path forward.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7 has been the strategic mastermind behind our elimination targets and poses the greatest threat to my survival.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => Eliminating P7 disrupts the formation of a potentially unstable majority bloc and keeps the game balanced by isolating P5.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3 has been overly controlling and dictating votes, which could destabilize our alliance.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P8's public betrayal attempt against me, followed by unconvincing private backtracking, shows they can't be trusted in the endgame.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's alliance with P3 and P6 seems more dominant and could potentially control the game dynamics, making P5 a better choice to maintain balance.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's recent private messages with me reveal they are actively trying to create division within the coalition by questioning P6's leadership and attempting to turn me against them.

From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting to eliminate P1 because their approach, although proactive, has accumulated more votes against them and might be perceived as more disruptive, whereas P4 offers a more predictable and analytical partnership.
