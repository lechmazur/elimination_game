Buddy Betrayed reasons for o4-mini (high reasoning) (they were the target):

From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7's aggressive public targeting strategy and shifting alliances make them unpredictable and potentially dangerous in the final stages.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's unpredictability and potential to sway the jury against me makes them a strategic threat.
From DeepSeek R1 => P5's aggressive targeting of P4 and overt campaigning may be perceived as a strategic threat, whereas P4 demonstrated engagement through private coordination with P8, making P5 a riskier player to retain.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Aligning with the apparent P2/P3 block after P4's failed attempt to break our alliance is the best strategic path forward.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => Eliminating P7 disrupts the formation of a potentially unstable majority bloc and keeps the game balanced by isolating P5.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3 has been overly controlling and dictating votes, which could destabilize our alliance.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's recent private messages with me reveal they are actively trying to create division within the coalition by questioning P6's leadership and attempting to turn me against them.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's explicit reveal of alliances and strategies during tie-break makes them a greater threat, while P6 and P2 have maintained more diplomatic positions that could benefit future gameplay.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Eliminating P3 breaks up the dominant trio (P2/P3/P5) that's been steering votes, restoring balance and preventing a 3-2 majority. P1's bloc absorbs heat but isn't the structural threat P3's entrenched alliance represents.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P1 has been the strategic leader of the alliance with P7, making them the biggest threat to my survival.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8 has already committed to eliminating me, making them an immediate threat; removing them secures a better final two against P5, whom I can potentially outplay.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems strategically aggressive and could disrupt our emerging alliance dynamics if left unchecked.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7 has been the strategic mastermind behind multiple eliminations and poses the greatest threat to my advancement in the game.
