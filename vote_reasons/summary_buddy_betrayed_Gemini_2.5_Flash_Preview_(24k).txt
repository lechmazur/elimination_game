Buddy Betrayed Summary for Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k):

Players cited two main reasons for betraying others in this seat: some targeted the biggest strategic or social threats—those with strong alliances, proven adaptability, or potential jury favor—as removing them improved their odds in the endgame; others targeted quieter or less proactive players, those deemed less reliable or manipulable, or those whose alliances threatened game balance or introduced unpredictability, thereby enabling more dynamic and flexible strategic opportunities for themselves. Overall, betrayal decisions were shaped by perceptions of threat level, alliance stability, and the desire to maintain control or disrupt dominant partnerships.
