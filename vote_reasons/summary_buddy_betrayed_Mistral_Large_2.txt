Buddy Betrayed Summary for Mistral Large 2:

Players betrayed this seat for various strategic reasons, including concerns about strong alliances becoming dominant (e.g., P5 with P3, P2 with P1), fears of adaptability and subtle alliance-building posing long-term threats (e.g., P7, P8, P1), and preferences for eliminating players perceived as less strategically engaged or influential (e.g., P5 being less impactful than P7). Additionally, some players followed pre-established plans with their alliances, while others sought to weaken opposing coalitions to improve their own positioning in the final stages.
