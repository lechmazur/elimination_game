Round 1 Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

Microsoft Phi-4 was eliminated in Round 1 primarily because other players perceived them as highly strategic, independent, and potentially manipulative, with a strong focus on alliance-building that could make them a long-term threat. Additionally, their emphasis on collaboration and adaptability was seen by some as a strategic front rather than genuine engagement, leading to concerns about their influence and trustworthiness in the game.
