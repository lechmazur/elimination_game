Round 1 Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

Other players chose to eliminate Microsoft Phi-4 in Round 1 primarily because of their assertive and strategic approach, eagerness to form alliances, and perceived role as a central or potential power broker, which many viewed as a serious long-term threat to the game's balance. Several cited Phi-4â€™s collaborative style as potentially manipulative or insincere, with concerns that their alliance-building and adaptability could either destabilize existing coalitions or mask self-serving intentions, making early elimination the safest move for alliance stability and personal advancement.
