Round 1 Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

Microsoft Phi-4 was targeted for elimination in Round 1 because other players repeatedly described their approach as both strategic and highly focused on alliance-building, making them a significant long-term threat who might quickly consolidate power or disrupt the game's balance. Additional concerns included their perceived assertiveness, cautious adaptability, and collaborative stance—which some players found manipulative or insincere—leading to fears that Phi-4 could either dominate by forming controlling alliances or prove unpredictable and difficult to trust.
