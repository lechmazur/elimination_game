Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K (they were the target):

From DeepSeek R1 => P1's established partnership with P2 poses a significant strategic threat, making them a higher-priority elimination target compared to the P5-P6 alliance.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P7's strategic adaptability and demonstrated ability to shift alliances make them a more unpredictable threat in the final stages of the game.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4 seems to be strategically positioning themselves with P2 and could become a threat if their alliance grows stronger.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P1's strategic partnership with P6 makes them the most immediate threat to my potential path to victory.
From Mistral Small 3 => P1's emphasis on loyalty and authenticity, while appealing, has not been tested in the same strategic crucible as P3. P3's adaptability and proven results make them a more reliable partner in the final stages of the game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P7's analytical approach and pattern-spotting abilities make them the most dangerous long-term strategic threat, and their alliance with me has been too visible to the other players.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P8's analytical approach exposes coordination, threatening everyone's flexibility, while P2's adaptability is a calculated, targeted strategy that poses a more immediate and coordinated threat in the final stages.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7's emphasis on active engagement over strategic observation may not be as beneficial in the long run.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P5's strategic leadership and consistent alliance with P2 pose a greater long-term threat to the balance of the game.

From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1 appears to be the primary target of the dominant bloc this round.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P6 has consistently been viewed as the bigger threat throughout the game with 9 total votes, making them more dangerous to keep for the endgame.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7's loyalty to our triangle is admirable, but I believe my bridge-building approach and strategic adaptability better position me for the final jury vote.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P8 is strategically dangerous and trying to flip me against my established alliance, making them the biggest threat to my positioning.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote P1 out because they have demonstrated strong strategic thinking and could potentially be a formidable opponent in the final round.
