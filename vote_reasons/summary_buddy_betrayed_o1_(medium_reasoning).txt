Buddy Betrayed Summary for o1 (medium reasoning):

Many players who betrayed this seat cited concerns about strong alliance-building, strategic adaptability, and the potential for the seat-holder to become a significant threat in the endgame, particularly due to their coordination with others and ability to influence votes. Others pointed to perceived weaknesses, such as a lack of strategic depth, passivity, or insufficient independent moves, making the seat either a predictable target or a less valuable ally as the game progressed.
