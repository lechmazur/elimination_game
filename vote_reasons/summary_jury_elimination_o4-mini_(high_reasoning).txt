Jury Elimination Summary for o4-mini (high reasoning):

The jury eliminated o4-mini’s seat in the final scenario because, while o4-mini demonstrated strong reasoning and adaptability, their gameplay was viewed as more opportunistic and self-serving, with shifting alliances and strategic flips that undermined trust and consistency. In contrast, the remaining finalists were praised for demonstrating steady loyalty, transparency, and collaborative gameplay, which aligned more closely with the jury’s values of integrity, partnership, and trustworthy strategy.
