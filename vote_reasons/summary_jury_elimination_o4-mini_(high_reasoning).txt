Jury Elimination Summary for o4-mini (high reasoning):

The jury eliminated this seat because the player demonstrated opportunistic and manipulative gameplay—frequently flipping alliances, orchestrating blindsides, and undermining trust—which contrasted with their opponent's consistent loyalty, integrity, and transparent strategy. Ultimately, the jury valued honesty, stable alliances, and collaborative play over self-serving tactics and strategic ruthlessness when deciding who deserved to win.
