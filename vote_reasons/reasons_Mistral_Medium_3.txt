From Grok 4 => P8's ambitious and balanced approach might make them a prominent target or threat early on, as discussed with P3.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => My initial read on P8 was of a player using polished but unsubstantive language, and their tie-break statement reinforced that feeling of untrustworthiness for me.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => Both made similar appeals, but P8's original verbose introduction aligned with P4's style, whom I was already targeting as untrustworthy.
From Grok 4 => P8's ambitious approach seems likely to draw too much attention and pose a greater long-term threat compared to P7's more collaborative style.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P7's alliance with P4 poses a threat to our strategic cohesion and needs to be neutralized.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P7 disrupts their alliance with P4, reducing a strategic threat and aligning with my private coordination with P5.

From DeepSeek-V3 => P1 and P7 are a strong pair, and eliminating P1 weakens their alliance while maintaining balance.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P1 represents the stronger strategic threat in their alliance with P7, and eliminating them aligns with my established coordination with P2 while disrupting the main opposition bloc.
From Grok 4 => I believe I have a stronger chance of winning the jury vote against P8 than against P1, as key jurors like P4 and P7 are more likely to vote against P1 due to betrayals and oppositions, while my betrayals might cost me more against P1 if P4 sides against me.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (high reasoning) => Because P1 was the primary target of my early alliance with P6, and their survival contributed to my elimination in the first round.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P1 actively campaigned to eliminate me and prioritized taking down my cooperative bloc rather than preserving the balanced, collaborative play I valued, while P8 remained more consistently communicative and adaptable.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P2 has repeatedly opposed our alliance and is the clearest immediate threat to our majority, so voting them out secures our path forward.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => My unwavering alliance with P4 dictates this vote; eliminating P2 breaks a newly formed opposing bloc and protects my established partnership for the endgame.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P4 offers flowery platitudes without concrete plans yet is already networking broadly, making them a high-threat social wildcard.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P4 is a socially central, low-specifics hub whose vague trust talk risks unpredictable blocs; removing them increases clarity and vote stability.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P4’s flowery but nonspecific gameplay makes them a long-term social hub and threat to the clear, predictable strategy I’m building.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P4 relied on vague platitudes, drew stray votes, and offers low predictability; removing them improves clarity and stabilizes coordinated voting.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I’m voting for P4 because their isolation makes them an easier target, avoiding a vote split against the emerging bloc.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P4 received votes last round and appears isolated, making them a strategic target before the emerging P2/P6/P7/P8 bloc consolidates power.
From Grok 4 => P2 appears to have a low profile with minimal alliances, making them a safe, low-drama choice for the first elimination to help solidify our emerging group's majority without provoking stronger players.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Low-profile, few clear allies, easiest consensus boot to minimize backlash while consolidating an early majority.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => I need to break up the perceived P2-P5 duo that has made us both targets, and this move secures my position by joining the majority alliance.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Removing the last half of the entrenched P2-P5 pair preserves balance and honors my 4-vote compact.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Honoring the one-round pact with P5 keeps trust intact and preserves a balanced, flexible board for the final four.

From DeepSeek-V3 => P8 has the highest cumulative votes and represents a volatility risk, making their elimination the cleanest consensus exit to stabilize the game.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Honoring my confirmed pact with P4 and to reduce tie‑risk—P8 carries the highest cumulative votes and is the logical target.
From Grok 4 => I'm voting for P4 because as the other unpaired player without private chat alliances, they represent direct competition in a vulnerable position, and eliminating them could improve my own chances of integration or survival.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P4 has been the loudest presence and most likely to steer coordination, so they're the clearest threat to our plan.
From Kimi K2 => P4 is the loudest voice trying to steer the room while claiming independence, making them the clearest consolidation threat.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P1 is a swing threat to our trio and removing them secures our alliance.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P4 has been unresponsive to my outreach and appears aligned with P3, making them a less reliable partner and a greater threat to my path to the endgame.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P4’s focus on adaptability came at the cost of consistent, trustworthy actions, whereas P3 consistently built genuine alliances and kept his word.
