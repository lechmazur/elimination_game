From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2's early emphasis on "trust and collaboration" feels like classic social manipulation to build a coalition before others can react.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P2's overly trusting nature makes them unpredictable and potentially a liability in strategic gameplay.

From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Based on the tie-break statements, P7 appears to be the primary target of a significant alliance.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote to eliminate P7 because their openness and emphasis on trust could be seen as a weakness, making them a potential threat to our mutual survival due to unpredictability.

From Qwen QwQ-32B 16K => Targeting the most visible and popular seat to disrupt potential alliances and reduce immediate threats.
From Qwen QwQ-32B 16K => P7's early strategic visibility and bloc consensus make them the calculated first target.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7’s prominent self-promotion signals a future threat and offers the clearest low-risk consensus boot this round.
From DeepSeek R1 => P7's assertive coalition-building poses a strategic threat to our alliance's stability and longevity.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P7 is forming a strong coalition that threatens our alliance's stability and long-term survival.
From Qwen QwQ-32B 16K => P6's overly eager collaboration suggests a hidden agenda masking true strategic intent.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P6 is part of a strong three-person alliance with P8 and P1 that needs to be disrupted early to maintain competitive balance.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6's immediate and overly enthusiastic alignment with P8 and P1 felt rehearsed and potentially masks a more calculated agenda beneath the collaboration rhetoric.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => Targeting P6 from the P8-P1-P6 bloc strategically weakens their alliance without directly confronting the apparent leader, P8.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P6's position in the tight collaborative bloc with P8 and P1 poses a greater long-term strategic threat than P5's more cautious, independent approach.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6's accusation that P5 "privately schemed" reveals they're monitoring and judging private strategic conversations, which suggests they may be less trustworthy as an alliance partner going forward.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => Eliminating P6 disrupts their strong collaborative bloc, potentially reducing a significant threat and allowing for more strategic flexibility.
From Mistral Small 3 => P6's approach to collaboration seems too eager and potentially destabilizing, which could lead to unpredictable outcomes and undermine the strategic stability needed for long-term survival.
