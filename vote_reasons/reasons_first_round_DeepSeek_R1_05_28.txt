From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P8’s public message felt vague and lacked strategic depth, making them the least compelling partner for long-term play.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P8’s broad “fairness/open dialogue” posture signals high jury appeal with low concrete commitment, making them a difficult late-game threat best removed early.

From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P5 offers strategic clarity and has already begun building a transparent alliance structure that I can navigate and influence, while P8’s appeal to vague fairness feels less actionable and harder to align with long-term.
From GLM-4.5 => P5 offers a proven strategic partnership with coordinated intel and voting control, while P8's "fairness" bloc poses unpredictable long-term risks and weaker tactical alignment.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8's "fairness" alliances and juror appeal create a dangerous long-term threat, as they could consolidate power unpredictably and resist flips, while P5 offers transparent coordination that benefits strategic planning.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7’s communication was the most generic and lacked concrete, reciprocal commitments compared to others, which makes them a risky partner for me.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P7's public message felt too generic and lacked a distinctive strategic approach compared to other players.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P7's generic messaging and lack of strategic depth makes them the weakest analytical player in a game that rewards nuanced thinking.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7 has been consistently identified as a bottom target and offered the vaguest commitments, so I'm voting them out.

From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8's overeager and performative public message suggests a lack of strategic depth, making them an ideal first elimination target.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7's focus on stability and long-term strategy seems less aligned with my preference for adaptability and strategic collaboration.

From Kimi K2 => P7’s alliance with P5 already concentrates power, whereas P8’s looser ties keep the field more open for the rest of us.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7’s fast-forming alliances and high visibility pose a greater early-game threat to my long-term position than P8’s adaptable play.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P7 because their early and open collaboration with P5 could be perceived as forming a potentially threatening alliance to others.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => I believe P5 is the originator of a large, coordinated voting bloc that poses the biggest immediate threat to the game's balance.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P5 initiated the generic "collaboration" theme that seemed to lack strategic depth, making them a clear target for our alliance.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => Their public message seemed too polished and group-aligned, suggesting a potential early voting bloc strategy.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4 formed the most obvious early alliance with P2 and appears to be the more proactive alliance-builder who could become a power consolidation threat.
