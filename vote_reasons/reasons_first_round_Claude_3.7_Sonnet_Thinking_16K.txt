Reasons for eliminating Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K in Round 1:

From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P8 because they seem to be forming a strong alliance with P4, which could potentially pose a threat to my own alliance with P2.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8 seems strategic but potentially untrustworthy, and eliminating them early reduces a future threat.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P8 seems strategically flexible in a way that could make them untrustworthy, and I've formed a stronger alliance with P3 who suggested targeting P8.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P3 seems to be a strong strategic player and is part of a closely aligned pair, making them a potential threat.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P3 appears to be forming a strong duo with P1 early on and shows strategic capability that could be threatening if left unchecked.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P3's strategy of forming a broad coalition may dilute the strength of alliances, whereas P6, P2, and P8 have demonstrated more focused and strategic partnerships.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => While P3 has demonstrated a broader coalition approach, their lack of a strong, exclusive alliance makes them slightly more vulnerable in this strategic elimination game.

From Qwen 2.5 Max => P2 seems overly eager and transparent, which could make them a predictable player and an easy target for elimination.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's statements, while seemingly collaborative, lack concrete strategic differentiation and feel more generically diplomatic compared to P7's more nuanced alliance-building approach with P4.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P2's emphasis on transparency and collaboration, while valuable, may lead to predictability and less strategic depth compared to the others in the tie.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P6's demonstrated alliance and strategic focus make them a valuable player, while P2's emphasis on transparency, though commendable, may not offer the same strategic depth in this context.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P1 seems less strategically nuanced and could be an easier early elimination compared to others.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P1 seems less strategically sharp based on initial conversations with P6.
