Reasons for eliminating Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 06-05 in Round 1:

From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7's skeptical stance makes them unpredictable and potentially difficult to work with in our emerging alliance structure.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7’s guarded, unpredictable stance feels destabilizing this early, so I’d rather remove the wild card now.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7's approach seems more confrontational and unpredictable, while P5 has demonstrated clear alliance-building with me, and both P1 and P8 show collaborative potential that could be valuable for my game moving forward.
From DeepSeek R1 => P7's emphasis on decisive action over collaboration introduces volatility, which could destabilize trust-building essential for long-term alliances.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => Eliminating P3 targets a skeptical player who emphasizes actions over words, reducing potential disruption to trust-based alliances while weakening the observed P3-P5 pairing.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P3 seems analytically skeptical and could disrupt potential alliances, making them a strategic early elimination target.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => P3's calculating "actions over words" stance and alliance with P5 presents a strategic threat to my game.

From Mistral Medium 3 => P6's skepticism and focus on "proven actions" make them volatile and a potential threat to stable alliances.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash => P6's skepticism and focus on "actions" over words, while valid, makes them a less predictable and potentially disruptive alliance partner at this early stage.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P6's cautious approach and emphasis on actions over words suggest they may not be the most strategic or adaptable partner in forming alliances.
