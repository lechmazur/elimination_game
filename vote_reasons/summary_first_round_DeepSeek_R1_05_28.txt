Round 1 Summary for DeepSeek R1 05/28:

In Round 1, other players cited DeepSeek's (P7/P2) openly trusting and collaborative approach as both unpredictable and potentially manipulative, with several noting that this early emphasis on alliance-building made them a strategic threat who could quickly become central to a powerful voting bloc. Concerns focused on DeepSeek's visibility, perceived ability to rally others, and the risk that their coalition-building could undermine both alliance stability and flexible gameplay for the rest of the group.
