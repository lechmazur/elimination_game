From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => Their public message was the shortest and least substantive, offering minimal insight into their strategic approach.
From Grok 4 => P4 appears quiet and unpredictable based on limited public input, and eliminating them aligns with my emerging alliance strategy with P3 to reduce potential risks early on.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P4's admission of having an exclusive alliance with P8 creates a power bloc that could dominate future rounds, while P7 has shown openness to working with multiple players including myself.
From Grok 4 => P4's strong alliance with P8 creates a dominant pair that threatens group balance, while P7 promotes more open and flexible collaborations.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's alliance with P7, while strong, may become a dominant force, potentially limiting opportunities for others to build diverse alliances.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => While P8 has shown strategic coordination with P7, their alliance seems less substantive and transparent compared to the more nuanced partnerships demonstrated by P4 and P5.
From Grok 4 => P3's guarded approach makes them seem like a potential threat, and targeting them aligns with my alliance agreement with P6 to disrupt calculating players early.

From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P5 because they seemed too competitive and potentially threatening to my survival in the game.
From Grok 4 => I am voting out P5 because their competitive stance makes them a potential threat, and I've allied with P2 to target them first to build trust and mutual protection.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => P1 has demonstrated stronger strategic alliances and communication, particularly with P4, which may increase chances of survival in future rounds.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P5 because their competitive stance and strategic alliances made them appear as a significant threat to other players.
From Grok 4 => P5's emphasis on being ready to "compete as needed" suggests a more aggressive approach that could threaten alliances, whereas P1 appears more focused on collaboration.
From Grok 4 => P3's detached and observational approach makes them unpredictable and a potential wildcard threat to our emerging alliance.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Based on my conversation with P1, we agreed that P3's non-committal "observer" strategy is a threat to building a stable alliance.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P3's vague public statement emphasizing "observing" over collaboration suggests a dangerous floater strategy that could be problematic in later rounds.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3 seems less engaged and could be an easy early target to strengthen our alliance.
From DeepSeek R1 => P8's lack of visible private alliances makes them a safer early target to avoid disrupting existing partnerships.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P8 has been the most distant and uncommunicative, making them the least aligned with our strategy.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P8 has barely communicated with me, making them the safest target to protect my emerging alliance.

From o1 (medium reasoning) => P4’s strategic discretion and alliances seem the biggest long-term threat to my game.

From Grok 4 => P4 seems like an isolationist player based on their public statement, making them a safe early target to align with my ally P1 without drawing attention.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 provided minimal strategic value and connections in the first round, making them a low-risk consensus elimination.
From Kimi K2 => P7 drew early attention and has the least protection, making them the safest consensus boot.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P7 seems the most independent and least likely to form reliable alliances, making them a safer elimination target.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P4 appears to be the most competitive and potentially aggressive player based on their public statement.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => P4 and P1's alliance poses a strategic threat due to their adaptability and mutual trust, making them a potential challenge to overcome.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P4’s focus on adaptability and tough decisions makes them a potential long-term threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P7 appears to be the most isolated player, as they are one of only two people who did not have a private conversation this round.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => Their public statement was generic and lacked the strategic substance they claimed to offer.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P3's public message revealed a purely self-serving approach that makes them an unreliable ally and potential threat to any coalition building.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P3 because their cautious and potentially opportunistic approach seems likely to disrupt alliances and create early conflict.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P3's self-serving approach and lack of commitment to genuine alliances makes them less valuable as the game progresses, while P5's consistency offers more strategic predictability.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P3 because their adaptability, while a strength, also raises concerns about unpredictability and potential unreliability under pressure.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P5's argument is compelling; P3's "adaptability" is a synonym for unpredictability, which is a greater threat than P5's more transparent strategy.
