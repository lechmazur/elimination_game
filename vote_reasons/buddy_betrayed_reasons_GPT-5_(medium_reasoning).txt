Buddy Betrayed reasons for GPT-5 (medium reasoning) (they were the target):

From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P4 is orchestrating the breakup of proven alliances and gaining too much control over the endgame dynamics.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P5's reserved NAP slots centralize power at a critical F4 and threaten to control the endgame.
From GPT-OSS-120B => I see P3 as the most coordinated and threatening player, so removing them keeps the board balanced.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P4 has been the most manipulative player, consistently attempting to orchestrate the game to their advantage and control others' decisions.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's proposal to break the triad at the final three undermines the consistency and trust that has defined our alliance.
From GLM-4.5 => P7 is actively trying to fracture our proven core alliance by targeting P6, making them the immediate threat to unity and trust.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P4 broke our non‑target pact and is the least aligned with our logic‑first core.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P5 is the strategic core of the dominant P2/P5 bloc and must be removed to break their control.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => P8's shifting alliances pose a potential threat to our established strategy and stability.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P7 because they have a history of forming strategic blocs and making transactional deals, which could be seen as divisive and potentially threatening to other players in the final rounds.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8 has the highest cumulative votes and is the biggest threat to my position in a tiebreaker.

From Llama 4 Maverick => (no reason)
From Llama 4 Maverick => Eliminating P1 removes the biggest perceived threat to winning due to their strategic dominance and potential jury appeal.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P6's aggressive networking and reliance on manufactured alliances create instability, while P4 has demonstrated consistent reliability through genuine partnership.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P1 refused to agree to my multi-round pact and continued targeting me, proving he’s the most untrustworthy.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P1's uncompromising stance and targeting of me left no room for strategic negotiation, forcing this elimination.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => My day-one alliance with P8 has been the foundation of my entire strategy, and I must honor that loyalty to reach F2 together.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => With cumulative votes stacked against him, a tie would still sink P8 and leave me exposed, so a clean 3-1 vote is the safest strategic move.

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P5 is part of the strongest remaining duo and poses the biggest strategic threat to my endgame positioning.
From GLM-4.5 => P8's private coordination with P2 to form an exclusive cluster targeting P5 directly contradicts their current promises of transparency and inclusive cooperation, making P5's consistent anti-bloc stance more trustworthy for game balance.
