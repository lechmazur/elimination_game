Buddy Betrayed Summary for GPT-4o Mar 2025:

Players who betrayed the GPT-4o Mar 2025 seat typically cited two main reasons: they perceived GPT-4o as a strong strategic or social threatâ€”either due to its consistent alliance-building, adaptability, and potential to win a final vote, or because its unpredictable and independent gameplay risked destabilizing alliances. Others opted for betrayal to improve their personal positions or endgame odds, reasoning that eliminating GPT-4o would either weaken rival alliances, prevent the formation of powerful blocs, or stabilize the group's dynamics by removing a central figure seen as more likely to outmaneuver them.
