From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 voted me out early and later flipped on allies (P8, P7, P3), while P5 consistently honored stated pacts and delivered promised protection.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P6's claim of playing with integrity and without backstabbing is directly contradicted by my own elimination, where P6 participated in a betrayal after our alliance was established.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P5's accusation that P3 "shifted loyalties" is demonstrably false—P3 maintained a consistent alliance with P5 throughout the game without betrayal. P3’s strategy focused on transparent, adaptive collaboration (e.g., aligning with P5 early and staying the course), while P5’s smear attempt undermines their own credibility. P3’s actions aligned with their stated values of "genuine connections" and strategic clarity, making them the more trustworthy winner.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P3 is not part of my core alliance and is the logical early target for my coalition.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P3 is vocal and likely to form a strong P1/P3 pairing, so I'm voting to break that alliance early.

From Mistral Medium 3 => P2's argument focused more on attacking P3's character rather than demonstrating a consistent, principled strategy throughout the game, while P3 maintained a more reflective and balanced approach.
From GPT-4o mini => P2's accusation of manipulation against P3 seems more like a defensive tactic rather than a reflection of actual gameplay, indicating a lack of accountability for their own actions.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => I vote to eliminate P2 because P3 showed steadier, more principled play while P2’s moves felt more self-serving and less trustworthy to me.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2's accusation of P3 being manipulative rings hollow when both players clearly worked together throughout the game, making P2's attempt to throw their ally under the bus at the final moment seem more dishonest than P3's consistent messaging about collaboration and fair play.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3 has shown adaptability but lacks the consistent strategic alignment and resilience demonstrated by P6.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P3 explicitly coordinated with P2 to eliminate me, making P3's claim of P6 eliminating strong players like me disingenuous and manipulative.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => Targeting P4 this round helps weaken P1's shield, aligning with our strategy to maintain a strong position for future rounds.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P4's consistent coordination with P3 and public criticism of my past moves make them a greater strategic threat to eliminate now.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P3 stayed loyal and strategic while P4 spearheaded the blindside that sent me packing—so I’m rewarding loyalty and resilience.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P6 voted against me in the previous round and weakening their alliance with P7 serves my long-term strategy.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => They voted against my ally P8 and appear allied with P7, making them an immediate threat to our partnership.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P6 because their alliance with P7 is perceived as a threat, and removing them disrupts a potentially strong bloc while maintaining the balance between P8 and P5.
