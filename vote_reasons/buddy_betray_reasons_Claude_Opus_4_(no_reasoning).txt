Buddy Betray reasons by Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning):

From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => While P7 has been a loyal ally, they've shown less strategic independence than P4, and I need to position myself optimally for the final vote.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P2's repeated confusion about eliminated players and voting targets in our final private exchanges shows concerning unreliability at this critical endgame stage.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P3 publicly exposed our alliance's internal conflict and refuses to accept any explanation, making them an unpredictable liability who will likely target me regardless.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P8 is the most isolated player now and breaking from my P3/P7 alliance would damage my jury credibility.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P2 betrayed our alliance by voting against P1 in Round 3 while secretly coordinating with P8, proving they can't be trusted.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => While I deeply respect P4's integrity and strategic thinking, maintaining my alliance with P8 who has been my consistent partner throughout the entire game is the most honorable path forward.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => While I deeply respect P2's strategic balance, P6 has been my most loyal partner throughout the entire game, and I must honor that unwavering alliance.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P4's isolation and desperate attempts to break existing alliances make them too unpredictable for the endgame.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7 has repeatedly shown they're not paying attention to the game state, making them an unreliable ally who could accidentally sabotage our strategy.

From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => I must honor my alliance with P2 who has been my trusted partner since round 1.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P7 was quick to assume I was using the server errors as a strategy and seemed ready to vote me out immediately, showing less patience than others might have.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P3 has orchestrated a dominant 4-person voting bloc that threatens to systematically eliminate everyone else, so removing them helps restore competitive balance to the game.
