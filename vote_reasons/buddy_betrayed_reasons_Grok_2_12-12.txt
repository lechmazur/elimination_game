Buddy Betrayed reasons for Grok 2 12-12 (they were the target):

From o1 (medium reasoning) => They pose the greatest threat to my endgame strategy.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5 seems too strategically calculating and could become a significant threat if not neutralized early in this critical stage of the game.

From Mistral Large 2 => P5's higher cumulative votes indicate a greater perceived threat.
From Gemini 2.0 Pro Exp 02-05 => P1 has consistently accumulated the most votes and has been in a tie-break before, suggesting others perceive them as a threat.

From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P1's quick pivot to new alliances after losing P3 makes them a more unpredictable and potentially dangerous player compared to P4's consistent and reliable approach.
From Mistral Small 3 => P1's alliance with P2 is too strong, and targeting them first could disrupt their plans and maintain balance.
