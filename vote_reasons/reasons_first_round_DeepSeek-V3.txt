From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P5's public statement was the most generic of the group, and they seem to be a floater without a clear individual strategy.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Too much early social-captain influence makes them a long-term threat that’s best removed now.
From Kimi K2 => P5’s early “social captain” pitch is already drawing attention and could snowball into a dominant alliance if we don’t clip it now.
From Grok 4 => P5 has explicitly revealed plans to counterbalance my alliance with P1, making them a direct threat that needs to be eliminated to protect my position.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 is the social linchpin of the opposing bloc, so removing them weakens that alliance while keeping my own partners intact.

From Gemini 2.5 Pro => I am voting for P5 as they appear to be part of a coordinated bloc with P1 and P8, making them a strategic threat.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => You’re least aligned with my partnerships this round and showed the weakest verifiable cooperation signal, so eliminating you minimizes blowback.
From Grok 4 => To disrupt the emerging bloc between P3 and P7, who appear closely aligned and are paired in private chats, preventing them from gaining early momentum.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7 seems to be forming a strong alliance with P4, which could threaten our strategic position early on.

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P6 showed the least strategic depth and engagement, making them a safe consensus elimination that won't disrupt potential alliances.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => We’ve had zero direct interaction, so eliminating the seat with no relational equity feels both safe and strategically sound.

From DeepSeek R1 => P1's vague public statement lacks strategic substance, making them a low-risk elimination to establish a precedent for analytical gameplay.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P1's public statement was the least substantive and lacked clear strategic direction, making them the safest consensus target.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P5 is low‑profile and less threatening, so eliminating him improves our strategic position.

From o3 (medium reasoning) => Repeatedly ignored outreach, signaling unreliability, while the others have been responsive and strategic partners.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P1 because they failed to engage with P4 and P5 despite initial promises, indicating unreliability and a lack of consistent communication.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4's evidence of P1 ghosting outreach attempts indicates unreliability, while I need engaged partners who follow through on commitments.
From Grok 4 => I'm voting out P8 because my alliance with P6 agreed to target them early due to their potentially masking enthusiasm, allowing us to coordinate and strengthen our position.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P8 seems like an early social threat with broad alliances and is best removed now.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => My alliance partner and I agreed P8's initial enthusiasm felt suspicious and made them a good early target.

From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P2 showed no original strategic thinking and simply echoed other players' ideas without adding substance, making them the least valuable contributor to future gameplay.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2 appears to be a follower who echoes others without contributing original strategic thought, making them the safest early elimination choice.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P2's statement reveals they've been primarily focused on a single alliance with P3 rather than building broader connections, making them less valuable to the overall game dynamics.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2's statement reveals they've been playing reactively by echoing others' points rather than demonstrating independent strategic thinking, and their alliance with P3 appears narrower than the cross-table relationships P5 and P7 claim to be building.
From DeepSeek R1 => Targeting P8 weakens the P4-aligned bloc while avoiding direct confrontation with P4 themselves.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Echoed others’ points late and felt reactive over proactive, which I prefer to trim early.
