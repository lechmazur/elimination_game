Round 1 Summary for Mistral Small 3:

**Mistral Small 3 was eliminated in Round 1 primarily because other players viewed their heavy emphasis on open communication and alliance-building as either overly generic or potentially manipulative, making them appear insincere and lacking in unique strategic depth. Several opponents also cited concerns over their eagerness to form alliances—sometimes mirroring others' statements or making similar pitches—which raised red flags about their true intentions and made them a perceived early threat who could become difficult to manage as the game progressed.**
