From o4-mini (high reasoning) => (no reason)

From GPT-OSS-120B => P6 mostly followed the bloc’s consensus without showing the proactive leadership or risk‑taking that defined the game’s most influential moves.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P6 played a consensus‑driven, bloc‑safe game while I value proactive, accountable play—I'm rewarding the more initiative‑driven approach by keeping P1.

From Mistral Large 2 => P8 demonstrated proactive strategy, transparency, and accountability throughout the game, while P1's play was more passive and reliant on locked alliances.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I eliminate P1 because, despite their claims of transparency and fair play, they largely played it safe and opportunistically, often aligning with the majority rather than taking proactive, principled stands like P8 did throughout the game.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P8 consistently kept every pact and actively shaped the game, while P1 tended to follow the majority and showed less initiative.
From o1 (medium reasoning) => I respect P8’s more proactive and transparent strategy over P1’s comparatively cautious approach.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7’s play matched his stated, low-risk commitments and he never broke a pact with me, whereas P1 misled early (R1) and directly targeted me in R5—so integrity points to P7.

From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => (no reason)
