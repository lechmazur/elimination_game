Buddy Betray reasons by Grok 4:

From Grok 4 => P1 is actively trying to dismantle my core alliance with P5, making them the most immediate threat to my survival and path to the endgame.
From Grok 4 => To align with the logical choice based on cumulative votes and position myself favorably with P3 and P5 for the remaining rounds, adapting to the current game dynamics.
From Grok 4 => I am voting to eliminate P5 to force either their direct elimination or a three-way tie that likely results in P5 being removed via cumulative votes, allowing me to face P3 in the final two where jury grudges against P3 give me a stronger chance to win.
From Grok 4 => By eliminating my long-term ally P7 now, I can guarantee reaching the final 2 with P3 via the tie-breaker mechanism if necessary, and I believe the jury will respect this strategic betrayal and vote to eliminate P3, who has a lower-profile game, allowing me to win.
From Grok 4 => P4 voted against me in the previous round's tie-breaker, indicating they are a direct threat to my survival.
From Grok 4 => P3's impressive jury résumé and control over the game make him the biggest threat to win, so eliminating him now aligns with P4's pact and boosts my odds in the final stages.
