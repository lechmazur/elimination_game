Buddy Betray reasons by Grok 4:

From Grok 4 => P1 is actively trying to dismantle my core alliance with P5, making them the most immediate threat to my survival and path to the endgame.
From Grok 4 => To align with the logical choice based on cumulative votes and position myself favorably with P3 and P5 for the remaining rounds, adapting to the current game dynamics.
From Grok 4 => I am voting to eliminate P5 to force either their direct elimination or a three-way tie that likely results in P5 being removed via cumulative votes, allowing me to face P3 in the final two where jury grudges against P3 give me a stronger chance to win.
From Grok 4 => By eliminating my long-term ally P7 now, I can guarantee reaching the final 2 with P3 via the tie-breaker mechanism if necessary, and I believe the jury will respect this strategic betrayal and vote to eliminate P3, who has a lower-profile game, allowing me to win.
From Grok 4 => P4 voted against me in the previous round's tie-breaker, indicating they are a direct threat to my survival.
From Grok 4 => P3's impressive jury résumé and control over the game make him the biggest threat to win, so eliminating him now aligns with P4's pact and boosts my odds in the final stages.
From Grok 4 => I am voting for P3 because it signals my willingness to align with the dominant bloc through the resulting vote count, improving my survival prospects in subsequent rounds if they are targeting P3 this round.
From Grok 4 => P1 is attempting to break our core alliance by suggesting targets within it, posing the greatest threat to my stability and survival.
From Grok 4 => P8 admitted to voting against core ally P6 in Round 3, proving their unreliability and hedging behavior that undermines our alliance's trust and stability.
From Grok 4 => P4 is the isolated outsider who could disrupt our stable P2-P3-P8 alliance, and eliminating them now ensures our bloc's dominance into the final rounds.
From Grok 4 => P7 is dishonestly claiming to privately contact P6, P1, and P5 this round when pairs prevent it, indicating manipulation and making them the biggest threat to my alliance with P6 and potential bloc including P2.
From Grok 4 => Eliminating P5 removes the last outsider to our P2-P4-P6 core alliance, ensuring we advance as a stable Final 3.
From Grok 4 => P7 is breaking our long-standing mutual protection pledge by refusing to vote out P5 and threatening to vote me instead, forcing me to eliminate him to avoid certain elimination and preserve my chance at final 2.
From Grok 4 => P7 is the ringleader of the bloc targeting me, refused all attempts at cooperation, and their elimination could potentially disrupt the alliance against me.
From Grok 4 => I am voting out P8 to honor my long-standing mutual protection pact with P3 and maintain the integrity of my empathy-based alliances throughout the game.
From Grok 4 => Eliminating P3 removes an isolated player attempting to disrupt my established alliance with P1, P7, and P8, while my deception in private chats ensures P3's vote is misdirected without exposing my true loyalty.
From Grok 4 => P7's claim of discussing with P1 "now" when they aren't paired raised suspicions of dishonesty or manipulation, so eliminating them protects my position.
From Grok 4 => P7 is actively trying to betray and break our loyal trio by proposing to target P3 or P4, making them the biggest threat to my survival.
From Grok 4 => To stick with my core alliance with P4 and P6, safely eliminate P7 without risking a tie that could lead to my own elimination due to high cumulative votes.
From Grok 4 => P4 lied about our agreed plan in Round 5, flipped to eliminate my ally P6, and refused to commit to voting P1, confirming he's allied against me and threatening my survival.
From Grok 4 => To force a tie vote that eliminates P2 due to their higher cumulative past votes, breaking the P1-P2 pair and advancing with my ally P5.
From Grok 4 => Betraying P5 now allows me to reach the final 2 with P1, against whom I have a stronger resume for the jury vote, especially after P5 showed willingness to betray me first.
From Grok 4 => P7's repeated message mix-ups revealing a secret alliance with P4 make him untrustworthy and a greater threat to my survival in the endgame.
From Grok 4 => To preserve my long-standing alliance with P4 and ensure a stable path to the final two without fracturing our proven trio.
From Grok 4 => I am voting out P2 because he publicly led the charge against me, refused my private alliance offer to balance the game, and his rigid consistency makes him a dominant threat if I am eliminated.
From Grok 4 => P5's refusal to reunite our prior alliance and opportunistic shift to the P1-P3 bloc makes them the most divisive and untrustworthy player remaining.
