Buddy Betray reasons by Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25:

From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P5 betrayed their long-term partner last round and likely made a deal with P1/P4 to eliminate me this round, making them the most immediate and untrustworthy threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P7 betrayed our agreed voting plan in two consecutive tie-breaks, proving completely untrustworthy.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P3 voted against my closest ally last round, demonstrating untrustworthiness and alignment with the opposing bloc.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P1 has accumulated significantly more votes against them throughout the game compared to P2, indicating they are perceived as a larger threat by the group.

From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P4 betrayed our long-standing alliance in Round 4 and cannot be trusted to stick to our agreement this round, making them the primary threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P1 broke our agreed vote last round, targeted my ally P3, and has been evasive about rebuilding trust.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P8 is the only player remaining outside the established P1-P2-P6 alliance, and eliminating them secures the final three for our core group.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P6 proposed a suspicious plan to vote P8 immediately after P8 saved P6, likely attempting to manipulate my vote while the P3/P6/P8 bloc targets me.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P4 seems to be the core strategist of the opposing alliance and consistently rejected any negotiation, making them the primary obstacle.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P5's recent private messages have been confused and unreliable, making them too unpredictable to trust in this final elimination before the finale.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P7 ignored my private messages this round, indicating they are not open to working together and are likely part of the coalition against me.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => My alliance with P7 has been consistent and effective throughout the game, and P1 represents the remaining opposition to our partnership.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => I was unable to establish any communication with P3 due to technical errors in both their public message and our private chat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => My private chat partner seemed confused about who was still in the game, making coordination unreliable.

From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => Voting P6 is necessary to save my ally P6, anticipating P3 will likely vote P6 again to force a tie and eliminate P6 via cumulative votes; this counters P3's move and eliminates P5, who voted against P6.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P8 voted for me last round despite our agreement, breaking trust, and their explanations were inconsistent.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => I could not communicate with P1 due to technical errors on their side, making them a complete unknown.

From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P7's evasiveness regarding the Round 2 vote breakdown within our proclaimed core, despite my direct questions, undermines the trust and transparency essential for reliable alliances.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P7 has consistently failed to address serious trust issues from past rounds and their current tie-break statement is outdated and irrelevant.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => Voting P4 is consistent with my stated goal of reaching a final three with P3 and P6.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P8's argument that the P3-P6 pair had become a clear target was persuasive, and at this critical stage, I need to consider strategic flexibility for my own survival as P8 suggested.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P1 is the publicly declared target of our P2-P3-P7 coalition, and this vote solidifies our path to the final three.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P5's recent and explicit considerations to break our long-term alliance in favor of P6 make P5 too unreliable and a direct threat to my path to winning.
