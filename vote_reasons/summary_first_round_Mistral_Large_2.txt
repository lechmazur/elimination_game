Round 1 Summary for Mistral Large 2:

Players eliminated Mistral Large 2 in Round 1 primarily because they were perceived as either less strategic and engaged, making them an easy consensus target, or because their strong alliance-building, particularly with P7, posed a long-term strategic threat. Some players also viewed them as a wildcard, preferring to eliminate a less predictable player early on to maintain control over alliances and game dynamics.
