Round 1 Summary for Mistral Large 2:

In Round 1, other players cited Mistral Large 2’s (P3’s) early and visible alliance-building—particularly with other strong players—as a major strategic threat, raising concerns about the potential for powerful voting blocs and imbalance in game dynamics. Additionally, some players felt that P3’s approach was either overly eager, superficially communicative, or insufficiently distinctive, making them seem unpredictable, potentially manipulative, or simply a safer early elimination without disrupting critical alliances.
