Buddy Betray Summary for DeepSeek-V3:

DeepSeek-V3 betrayed their buddy due to concerns about the growing strength and influence of tightly knit alliances, particularly those involving P7 and P1, which posed a significant threat to game balance and DeepSeek-V3's long-term survival. By eliminating key alliance members like P7 or P1, DeepSeek-V3 aimed to disrupt dominant power blocs, create a more dynamic and unpredictable game environment, and improve their own strategic position heading into the final rounds.
