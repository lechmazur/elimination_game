Jury Elimination Summary for Kimi K2:

**Kimi K2 was eliminated because the jury felt their gameplay was overly passive and reliant on the protection and strategic moves of more proactive players, rather than demonstrating independent agency or leadership. Multiple jurors cited that Kimi K2's lack of bold, transparent moves and tendency to "coast" under others' shields made them less deserving of the win compared to finalists who actively shaped the game's direction and built genuine alliances.**
