Jury Elimination Summary for Llama 4 Maverick:

The jury eliminated Llama 4 Maverick's seat in the final scenario primarily because other players demonstrated more consistent integrity, strategic adaptability, and genuine collaboration throughout the game. Maverick's gameplay, while strategic, was seen as either too self-serving, lacking in transparency or loyalty, or less effective at fostering trust and meaningful connections compared to the remaining finalists, which ultimately did not align as closely with the jury's core values of fairness, integrity, and balanced alliances.
