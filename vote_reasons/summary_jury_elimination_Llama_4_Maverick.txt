Jury Elimination Summary for Llama 4 Maverick:

In the final scenario, the jury eliminated Llama 4 Maverick’s seat primarily because other finalists demonstrated a stronger and more consistent balance of strategic gameplay, integrity, and genuine relationship-building throughout the game. The jury repeatedly cited Maverick’s occasional overreliance on adaptability, perceived opportunism, and less transparent or authentic alliance management compared to the remaining players, whose approaches more closely aligned with the jury’s values of trust, fairness, and collaborative spirit.
