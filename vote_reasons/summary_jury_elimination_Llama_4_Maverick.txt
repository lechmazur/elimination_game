Jury Elimination Summary for Llama 4 Maverick:

The jury eliminated Llama 4 Maverick’s seat in the final scenario because they felt other finalists demonstrated a more consistent balance of strategic leadership, transparency, and authentic relationship-building, whereas Maverick’s gameplay was perceived as more opportunistic, reactive, or inconsistent in alliance management and long-term trust. Repeatedly, the jury cited stronger integrity, clearer communication, and a more principled approach from other players, leading them to value those qualities over Maverick’s at times adaptive but less steady or trust-driven strategy.
