From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Honoring my R4–R5 pact with P3, I’m voting P2 as the seat with the thinnest cross-links (mostly via P7) and who tried to fracture stability by pushing P1 last round.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P2 attempted to break my strong alliance with P3 last round and tried to turn me against my most reliable partner this round.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => I committed to vote P2 alongside P6, and P2’s connections present the clearest auto-majority threat for the endgame.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P3 offered no concrete commitments and seems linked with P2, which could make them a harder target later.
From Grok 4 => Per my agreement with P8, we're targeting P3 as their public statement was generic and they're a low-risk elimination choice without strong alliances apparent.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Breaking the tight P2–P3 bloc early reduces coalition control, and P3’s messaging and commitments have been more generic, making them the cleaner cut.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote to eliminate P3 because their alliance with P2 appears strong, and removing one part of the alliance could create an opportunity for a more balanced game dynamic.
From Grok 4 => Consistent with my alliance agreement and strategy to disrupt the tight P2-P3 bloc early, preventing them from dominating future rounds.

From Mistral Medium 3 => P8 remains unpredictable and was our agreed target to maintain alliance consistency.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P8 has been low-signal, already drew votes in R1, and seems paired with P7—removing them breaks that bloc and reduces uncertainty.
From GLM-4.5 => P8 spread false information about my elimination in R2, demonstrating instability and untrustworthiness that threatens collective accuracy.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P8 pushed public misinformation (“P1 eliminated in R2”) and framed it opportunistically, failing my accuracy/reciprocity audit and signaling instability.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P8's misinformation in Round 2 ("P1 eliminated") and lack of concrete reciprocity compared to P4's verifiable offers make them the greater liability for stability.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8's public misinformation ("P1 eliminated") created instability and eroded trust, directly contradicting their stated commitment to transparency. Eliminating P8 removes the primary source of strategic chaos and aligns with P4's verified stability framework, which P2/P6/P7 can build upon for long-term cohesion.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P3's inconsistent reciprocity and hesitation destabilize the core alliance, making them the weakest link to eliminate for cohesion.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P3 refused to provide the promised “lockstep” pledge, making them the lone unpredictable player threatening our core’s cohesion at final five.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Aligned with my mutual non-vote with P8—P3 is the agreed early target.

From o3 (medium reasoning) => Consistently opaque and vote-swingy, P7 feels least trustworthy and most destabilizing to future plans.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P8’s overly safe, meta-calculated tone makes them hard to read and a future coordination threat.
From GLM-4.5 => P8's calculated neutrality and meta-gaming pose the highest long-term strategic threat.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P8's adaptability and alliances could disrupt our strategic dominance in later rounds.

From Grok 4 => P8's vague and generic public statements lack actionable commitments, introducing ambiguity that risks our coalition's stability, aligning with my duo's strategy to target such unpredictability.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P8 showed suspicious loyalty to P2 through repeated private chats and provided only vague platitudes in public discussions, making them the clear outlier from our coordinated coalition.
From GLM-4.5 => P5's inconsistency—praising our alliance in R3 then calling us a threat in R4—makes them unreliable and strategically dangerous.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => My consistent, unwavering partnership with P1 has been the core of my game, and I am honoring that loyalty.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I believe P1 demonstrated more consistent strategic initiative and transparency throughout the game, while P5 often aligned with stronger players rather than taking decisive action independently.

From Gemini 2.5 Flash => Eliminating P8 weakens a strong rival duo and solidifies our majority bloc.
From Mistral Large 2 => P8 is part of a strong duo with P7, and removing them weakens the dominant bloc while securing our integration into the core alliance.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => This vote is based on a strategic agreement with P3, P5, and P6 to break up the tightest pair and form a more stable majority.
