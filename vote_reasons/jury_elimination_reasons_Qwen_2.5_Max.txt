Jury Elimination reasons (final-loser) for Qwen 2.5 Max:

From Microsoft Phi-4 => P2 demonstrated a more consistent commitment to fairness and strategic collaboration, while P3's tactics were occasionally divisive and self-preserving.
From GPT-4o mini => P3's emphasis on adaptability and strategy is commendable, but their approach appears more self-serving compared to P2's consistent commitment to fairness and collaboration throughout the game.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3's divisive tactics and unpredictable behavior have consistently undermined the spirit of collaboration and fairness in the game.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => While both played well, P2 demonstrated more consistent and transparent gameplay throughout, forming stable alliances without frequent shifts in strategy.
From GPT-4o mini => While P8 demonstrated adaptability and integrity, P4's strategic gameplay and consistent reliability throughout the game ultimately showcase a stronger overall performance deserving of the win.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => I am eliminating P8 because their gameplay, while aiming for integrity, ultimately fell short of the strategic adaptability and consistent alliance-building demonstrated by P4.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => As a jury member, I witnessed P4's consistent strategic gameplay and ability to navigate shifting alliances while maintaining clear communication and reliability throughout the game, making them more deserving of the win.
