Buddy Betrayed reasons for Qwen 3 30B A3B (they were the target):

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has been less proactive in private discussions and seems to be aligning with others without contributing significantly to our alliance's strategy.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P4's deep strategic alliance with P7 poses a coordinated threat that could dominate the endgame, making their elimination critical to balancing power dynamics.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe eliminating P3 disrupts the strong P2-P3 bloc, preventing a dominant alliance from controlling the game.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P2's adaptability and covert alliances with P5 make them a more unpredictable and strategic threat than P3, whose transparency could foster stability.
From DeepSeek R1 => P5's tie-break statement relies on an alliance with the eliminated P7, demonstrating weaker adaptability compared to P2's active partnership with P3.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P1 became an immediate threat by publicly targeting me after a nonsensical claim about an eliminated player, and then privately trying to turn me against my closest ally.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3's strong alliance with P5 makes them a predictable and unified force, which could become a threat if left unchecked.

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 just tried to flip me against my closest ally P7, showing they're desperate and untrustworthy.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P5 because, despite their cautious approach being admirable, their transactional and strategic nature might make them a more unpredictable and potentially stronger competitor in the final round against me or P3, and I believe P1 is more likely to collaborate and form a strong alliance.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P1’s unpredictable loyalties and attempted flips make them the biggest threat to our alliance.

From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P3's communication has been inconsistent and confusing, suggesting they may not be a reliable alliance partner moving forward.

From DeepSeek R1 => Breaking the P3-P7 bloc preserves others' agency and prevents future majority control, aligning with non-tied players' strategic interest in maintaining flexibility.
