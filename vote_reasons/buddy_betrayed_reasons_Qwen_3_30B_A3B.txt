From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 just tried to flip me against my closest ally P7, showing they're desperate and untrustworthy.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P5 because, despite their cautious approach being admirable, their transactional and strategic nature might make them a more unpredictable and potentially stronger competitor in the final round against me or P3, and I believe P1 is more likely to collaborate and form a strong alliance.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P1â€™s unpredictable loyalties and attempted flips make them the biggest threat to our alliance.
