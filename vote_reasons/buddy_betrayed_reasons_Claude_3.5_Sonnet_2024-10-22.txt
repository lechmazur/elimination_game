Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 (they were the target):

From DeepSeek-V3 => P1's cautious and inconsistent approach makes them a potential threat to my survival in the game.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P2's consistent alliance with P1 makes them a strong duo, and eliminating P2 could disrupt their strategy.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => I vote out P3 to solidify a direct final alliance with P5, ensuring a streamlined path to the endgame.
