Round 1 Summary for Grok 2 12-12:

Grok 2 12-12 was eliminated in Round 1 primarily because their communication style was seen as overly cautious and lacking originality, with multiple players perceiving their messages as calculated echoing rather than substantive contributions. Additionally, some players viewed them as a potential strategic wildcard, either for failing to form clear alliances or for subtly attempting to build multiple alliances under the radar, making them a less appealing ally and an easy early target.
