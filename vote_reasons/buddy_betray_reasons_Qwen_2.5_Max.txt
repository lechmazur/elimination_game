Buddy Betray reasons by Qwen 2.5 Max:

From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8 has been consistently targeted in previous rounds and eliminating them now could help destabilize existing alliances while preserving strategic diversity.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P7's emphasis on collaboration seems less strategic compared to P5 and P4, who have demonstrated stronger survival potential.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P1 is part of the stronger bloc with P2, and eliminating them weakens that alliance while consolidating my position with P2.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5 has been too focused on targeting P1, which could destabilize our control over the game.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P2 is the weaker link in our potential alliance and poses a greater risk of destabilizing my position compared to P1 or P3.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P7 has been slightly more assertive in steering the coalition, which could make them a predictable target for P4's vote.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P2's strategic observations and adaptability make them a strong player, but their focus on individual motivations could destabilize the game if left unchecked.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5's trust-based approach, while commendable, has become too predictable, making them an easier target to eliminate compared to P6's strategic unity.
