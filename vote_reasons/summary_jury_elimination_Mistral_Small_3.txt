Jury Elimination Summary for Mistral Small 3:

The jury eliminated Mistral Small 3’s seat in the final scenario because they perceived other players, particularly P5, as demonstrating more direct strategic agency, adaptability, and transparent gameplay throughout the competition. In contrast, Mistral Small 3 was seen as relying more on others’ moves, lacking leadership in key decisions, and presenting arguments that felt more accusatory or reactive rather than highlighting their own strengths.
