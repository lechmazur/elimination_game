Jury Elimination Summary for Mistral Small 3:

The jury eliminated Mistral Small 3's seat in the final scenario primarily because their gameplay was perceived as too reactive, passive, or overly reliant on alliances and others' strategic decisions, rather than consistently demonstrating independent initiative, transparency, and adaptability. Jurors favored finalists who maintained a balanced approach, combining strategic depth with integrity, relationship-building, and a clear record of proactive, principled decision-making that aligned more closely with the game's core values of fair competition and collaboration.
