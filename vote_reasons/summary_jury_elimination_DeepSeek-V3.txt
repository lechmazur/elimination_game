Jury Elimination Summary for DeepSeek-V3:

**Summary of Jury's Reasons for Eliminating DeepSeek-V3's Seat (P5) in the Final Scenario:**

The jury cited that while P5 (DeepSeek-V3) demonstrated strategic thinking and adaptability, their gameplay was often viewed as overly self-serving and reliant on alliances without taking enough independent initiative, which sometimes undermined trust and collaboration. Compared to their opponent, the jury favored a player who consistently prioritized group cohesion, transparency, and principled gameplay, perceiving P5's approach as less genuine and occasionally manipulative, making them less deserving of the win.
