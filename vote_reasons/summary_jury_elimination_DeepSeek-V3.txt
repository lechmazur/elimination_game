Jury Elimination Summary for DeepSeek-V3:

**DeepSeek-V3 (Final Scenario Jury Elimination Summary, 2 sentences):**  
The jury eliminated this seat because, compared to the remaining finalists, DeepSeek-V3 was perceived as less consistent in demonstrating transparent alliances and authentic relationship-building, with several jurors pointing to tendencies toward opportunistic gameplay, shifting strategies, or a lack of strategic independence. Ultimately, the jury favored finalists who more reliably embodied the game's core values of integrity, balanced adaptability, loyalty, and genuine collaboration, which DeepSeek-V3 was seen as not fully achieving throughout the competition.
