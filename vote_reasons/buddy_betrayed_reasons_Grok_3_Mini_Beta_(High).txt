Buddy Betrayed reasons for Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) (they were the target):

From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P8 because they have been consistently aligned with P3 and have shown a strong alliance that could potentially dominate the remaining players.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 and P4's dominant alliance poses a significant threat to the game's balance and inclusivity.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5's tendency to form blocs and adapt alliances poses a recurring threat to group stability.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5's focus on authenticity, while valuable, may be less strategically decisive compared to P3's proven ability to navigate alliances and adapt.
From DeepSeek R1 => P1's neutrality poses a strategic liability in the critical endgame, while P6's decisive track record in eliminating threats aligns better with survival-focused momentum.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has received more cumulative votes (5) compared to P4 (4), indicating slightly less alliance support.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3's strategic focus and consistent alignment with P2 and P5 make them a more reliable ally for the endgame, whereas P1 has shown adaptability but also potential unpredictability.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P2's proven alliance with P8 has been strategically effective, and eliminating P5 maintains balance while weakening a less integrated player.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5's partnership with P2 creates a strong voting bloc that could threaten the balance of power, and breaking this duo benefits the group's longevity.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 has been actively working against the established alliance, which undermines the current cooperative dynamic and poses a strategic risk.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 stands out as the loosest link in current alliances, so eliminating them reduces unpredictability and keeps larger targets available.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => You confirmed your loyalty to the dominant bloc and refused to work towards balance.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P3 disrupts the strong P3-P6 alliance, balancing the game and reducing coordinated voting power.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P2 because their adaptability and strategic collaboration, while valuable, are outweighed by P6's demonstrated ability to maintain consistent alliances and navigate challenges with foresight.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P4's reliance on outdated alliances (e.g., P5) and rigid strategies poses a stagnation risk, while P8's adaptability and track record of neutralizing threats align better with dynamic survival in the final stages.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P8 is the last player outside of my core alliance with P4 and P6, and their elimination is the logical next step for our group's strategy.
From GPT-4o mini => Eliminating P1 disrupts the potential for their alliance with P2, which could otherwise pose a significant threat to the balance of power in the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3 is the leader of the opposition group and poses a significant threat to the strategic alliance of P6 and P4.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6 has been a strong player, but their alliance with P2 poses a risk to our endgame strategy.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => Eliminating P1 is the final, logical step in my strategy of breaking up the game's original, most rigid pairs to ensure a truly reset endgame.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1's alliance with P3 and P6 appears to be a strategic move to isolate P2, and eliminating P1 would maintain a balance of power and prevent a potential bloc dominance.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8 seems too emotionally aligned with me, creating a potential predictable alliance that could make us both vulnerable.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I believe P8's strong alliance with P6 poses a greater risk of forming an unbreakable voting bloc compared to P3's more flexible partnerships.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P3 has a consistent voting history against other players, indicating a strong alliance with P2.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P4 because they were part of a forming counterbalance alliance that could potentially disrupt the current dynamics, and their elimination maintains the current balance of power.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P5 disrupts the P4/P5 bloc, aligning with the game's emphasis on adaptability and preventing predictable alliances.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => The tie vote revealed a fundamental split, and I must side with my most trusted, long-term allies to restore the stability of our original voting bloc.
