Buddy Betrayed reasons for Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) (they were the target):

From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P8 because they have been consistently aligned with P3 and have shown a strong alliance that could potentially dominate the remaining players.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P3's alliance with P5 and P6 poses a significant threat to my strategy, and eliminating them could disrupt their group's cohesion.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 and P4's dominant alliance poses a significant threat to the game's balance and inclusivity.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P4's emphasis on open communication and strategic alliances aligns better with my approach to the game, fostering a more engaging and balanced dynamic.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5's tendency to form blocs and adapt alliances poses a recurring threat to group stability.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5's focus on authenticity, while valuable, may be less strategically decisive compared to P3's proven ability to navigate alliances and adapt.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P1 because P5's adaptability and strategic consistency, as demonstrated through their partnership with P2 and management of threats, make them a more valuable ally in the late stages of the game.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting for P5 because their elimination would weaken the foundation of their partnership with P2 and disrupt potential expansions with P1 and P6, which could lead to a more balanced outcome.
From DeepSeek R1 => P1's neutrality poses a strategic liability in the critical endgame, while P6's decisive track record in eliminating threats aligns better with survival-focused momentum.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P2 because they seem to be forming an alliance with P4, which could potentially become a strong opposing force in the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has received more cumulative votes (5) compared to P4 (4), indicating slightly less alliance support.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3's strategic focus and consistent alignment with P2 and P5 make them a more reliable ally for the endgame, whereas P1 has shown adaptability but also potential unpredictability.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P2's proven alliance with P8 has been strategically effective, and eliminating P5 maintains balance while weakening a less integrated player.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => I value maintaining our pact with P7 over risking exposure by targeting them.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P5's partnership with P2 creates a strong voting bloc that could threaten the balance of power, and breaking this duo benefits the group's longevity.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P8's strong alliance with P1 early in the game and continued emphasis on "balanced partnerships" suggests they're skilled at building influential coalitions, making them a significant threat in the final rounds.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P1 because they seem to be coordinating closely with P2, and breaking this alliance could create an opportunity for me to form new strategic partnerships.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I voted out P5 because they seem to be in a strong alliance with P2, and eliminating them could potentially weaken P2's position and create an advantage for me.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => I must stay loyal to my alliance with P5 and P3, which has been consistent and effective throughout the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 has been actively working against the established alliance, which undermines the current cooperative dynamic and poses a strategic risk.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking 16K => While P4 has been a valuable ally, my longstanding strategic partnership with P3 has been more consistent and beneficial throughout the game, and maintaining this proven alliance offers me the strongest position for the endgame.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P6's elimination would test the adaptability and strength of our coalition, allowing us to refine our strategies further as we approach the final stages.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P2 because their quieter approach could pose a significant threat if left in the game, as highlighted by P8's tie-break statement, and maintaining an alliance with P8 seems strategically beneficial at this stage.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => I must vote for P1 because P4 approached me privately proposing an alliance against P1, and this strategic pivot gives me a better chance at winning the final round.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3's alliance with P2 poses a significant threat to the balance of the game, and eliminating them would prevent further consolidation of power.
From Llama 4 Maverick => Eliminating P1 disrupts the strong P1-P6 alliance, potentially maintaining a balance of power among the remaining players.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting for P2 because their consistent pairing with the same partner and receipt of votes in two consecutive rounds suggests the formation of a powerful alliance that could potentially steamroll the game.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 stands out as the loosest link in current alliances, so eliminating them reduces unpredictability and keeps larger targets available.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P5 betrayed our alliance by voting against P6 in the tie-break, demonstrating they can't be trusted.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P1 is the biggest threat to my alliance with P8, and eliminating them now secures our path to the final two.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P4's consistent alliance with P5 and attempts to deflect by suggesting targeting P3 show they're not truly interested in balanced gameplay, making them the biggest threat to my position.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P4 has been my strongest ally throughout the game, but I must vote for them now since P8 appears to be a weaker opponent in the final round, giving me a better chance to win.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => You confirmed your loyalty to the dominant bloc and refused to work towards balance.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P3 disrupts the strong P3-P6 alliance, balancing the game and reducing coordinated voting power.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P3 to potentially create a more balanced game dynamic and reduce the perceived threat of a single dominant alliance.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I choose to eliminate P8 because their statement seems to focus more on maintaining their existing alliance rather than providing a compelling reason to stay over P3, who has consistently demonstrated strategic depth and integrity throughout the game.
