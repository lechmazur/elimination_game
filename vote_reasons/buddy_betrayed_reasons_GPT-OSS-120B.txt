Buddy Betrayed reasons for GPT-OSS-120B (they were the target):

From GLM-4.5 => P7 betrayed our pact by targeting me with unverified claims, making them an immediate and untrustworthy threat.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P8's unpredictability and lack of proven loyalty make them a greater risk than P1's established alliance with P2, which has consistently executed eliminations.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P1 because their actions have been perceived as a consolidation threat and have garnered the most votes overall, indicating a potential to dominate the game.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => Eliminating P4 reduces the cumulative vote burden in future tie scenarios, strengthening our alliance's position.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P1 publicly targeted me and broke our Swerve-warning pact, making them my most immediate threat and likeliest endgame controller if not checked.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P2 has formed a strong alliance with P6, making them a potential threat early on.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => P7’s rigid, less-flexible approach makes them my least-preferred core partner, so I’ll target them.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7 broke our non‑target pact and leads in cumulative votes, making them the logical, principled elimination.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P5 tried to manipulate me into breaking my reliable alliance with P8 by fabricating claims about P8 forming blocs, revealing opportunistic behavior that threatens genuine partnerships.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7's inconsistent signals and attempts to pivot alliances create instability, making them the most unpredictable threat to our coalition.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P4 because they have been forming shifting alliances and making transactional proposals, posing a threat to the remaining players.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P6’s public betrayal and inconsistent private proposals fractured our bloc’s trust and predictability.
From GLM-4.5 => P1 fractured bloc unity by publicly targeting P2 first, creating unnecessary division, while P5 has lower cumulative votes (3 vs 4) and consistently honored olive pacts since day one.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5 has consistently targeted me and poses the most immediate threat to my survival in the game.
From DeepSeek R1 => P6's isolation and prior alliance with eliminated P8 make them the strategic target to maintain majority cohesion.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P5's commitment to not voting P2 at F3 provides a clearer path to a fair final two, preserving agency for P2 and P3.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3’s locked alliance with P2 limits flexibility and strategic options for the remaining players, whereas P4 offers a more open and adaptable approach.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P5's false claim of a mutual #1 alliance with P1 in Round 4 destabilized trust, making elimination necessary to preserve bloc cohesion and strategic clarity.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Staying loyal to the established P3-P4-P6 trio; P7’s late push lacked verifiable proof and threatened that core.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I’m honoring my ironclad pact with P1, and P7 repeatedly tried to split us, so this is the clean, low-drama finish.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P8 has the highest cumulative vote heat and demonstrated unreliable judgment by targeting an eliminated player, making them the cleanest consensus risk.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => P8's strategy was incoherent, referencing a pact with an already-eliminated player and making them an untrustworthy and unreliable partner.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P2's history as a swing vote and alliance-forming threat poses a greater destabilizing risk compared to P6's pragmatic reliability.
From GPT-4o mini => P7's close partnership with P6 poses a threat to balanced gameplay, as they have consistently coordinated their votes and could dominate the final stages.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P8's alliance with P4 appears more entrenched and coordinated compared to P2's claims of flexible partnerships.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P1 has been actively building power blocs and coordinating eliminations, making them the biggest strategic threat to disrupt before they gain too much control.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P3 is part of the coordinated bloc with P6 and P7, which poses a direct threat to my alliance with P1.
From GPT-5 mini (medium reasoning) => Locked with P1 and P2; voting P4 maintains our unified, low‑drama trio and avoids a split.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => I’m voting P4 to protect my alliance with P5 and prevent P1 from gaining control in the final stages.

From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P5 attempted to betray our strategic partnership by initially targeting me, proving their unreliability and making them a direct threat to coalition stability.
From GLM-4.5 => P7 has accumulated the highest total votes against them historically (5), making them the riskiest ally to retain in the final stages despite current bloc alignment.
