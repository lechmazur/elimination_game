From Gemini 2.5 Pro => My vote upholds the strategic pivot agreed upon with my closest ally, demonstrating consistent loyalty and follow-through.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => Given the revealed voting pattern and P2's insurmountable cumulative vote deficit in a potential tie, my vote must adapt to the new power dynamics to secure my path forward.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P6's focus on forming a wider bloc might dilute the strength of our existing alliances and introduce unpredictability.
