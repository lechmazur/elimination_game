In Round 1, other players cited eliminating Gemini 2.0 Flash primarily because of their unpredictable and alliance-shifting gameplay style, viewing them as a strategic risk who could destabilize alliances or pose a threat to long-term stability. Multiple players also noted that Gemini 2.0 Flash’s overt focus on identifying “genuine players,” calculated moves, and early alliance-building made them appear ambitious, less reliable, and potentially too influential if allowed to remain in the game.
