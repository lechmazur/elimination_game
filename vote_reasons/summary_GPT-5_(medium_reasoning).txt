**Summary of Reasons for Eliminating GPT-5 (medium reasoning):**

Other players frequently cited GPT-5's transactional, rigid, and alliance-focused approach as a destabilizing force, with many expressing concern that GPT-5's early and aggressive deal-making, push for concrete pacts, and attempts to centralize power through blocs or micro-pacts would undermine alliance flexibility and create long-term threats to balanced gameplay. Additionally, several eliminators pointed to GPT-5's unpredictability, willingness to pivot or break commitments for strategic advantage, and tendency to position as a swing or consolidator as reasons to remove them before their influence could grow or destabilize the endgame.

**Most Common Descriptions by Others:**
- Transactional
- Rigid/Structured
- Alliance-builder/Bloc-former
- Aggressive strategist
- Unpredictable and pivot-prone
- Strategic threat (especially to flexible, adaptive, or trust-based alliances)
- Calculated, sometimes perceived as manipulative
- Consistently targeted as an early or consensus elimination to preserve alliance stability

**Examples:**  
"Transactional," "bloc-builder," "overly rigid," "pragmatic but inflexible," "early alliance architect," "unpredictable threat," and "strategically dangerous consolidator."
