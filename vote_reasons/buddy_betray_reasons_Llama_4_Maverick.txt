Buddy Betray reasons by Llama 4 Maverick:

From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P6 because their emphasis on "bloc survival" and "unified decisions" could lead to rigid control, stifling the adaptability and open communication that have been crucial to our bloc's success so far.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P2 because their strong alliance with P8 could be perceived as a significant threat if they continue together, and eliminating P2 might disrupt this potential powerhouse alliance.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P7 because they have shown significant adaptability and strategic thinking, making them a strong threat in the final rounds.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P1 because they have been too closely aligned with me throughout the game, making them a potential threat if they were to turn against me in the future.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted P1 out because their strategy of maintaining multiple alliances risks being perceived as non-committal and potentially threatening to others.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P8 because their analytical approach, while valuable, seems less action-oriented compared to my proactive strategy.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I vote for P4 because, despite P7's portrayal of P4 as a threat, P4's strategic adaptability and nuanced analysis could be valuable. However, the risk associated with P4's independence and the potential disruption they might cause to the alliance is outweighed by the potential benefits of maintaining the current cooperative structure. Yet, upon closer inspection, the votes and statements suggest that P4 is seen as a significant threat, and their elimination is advocated strongly by P7, who is part of the core alliance. The decision hinges on whether the perceived threat is worth eliminating.
