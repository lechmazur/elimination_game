Jury Elimination Summary for GLM-4.5:

The jury eliminated GLM-4.5's seat in the final scenario primarily because they perceived its gameplay as overly reactive, reliant on majority or alliance dynamics, and lacking in independent, proactive strategic agency. Multiple jurors cited a pattern of passivity, vague or misleading claims about other players, and a failure to build or honor transparent, verifiable alliances, contrasting this with the finalist's consistent integrity, adaptability, and ownership of strategic moves.
