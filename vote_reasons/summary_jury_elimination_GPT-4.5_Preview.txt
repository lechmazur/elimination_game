Jury Elimination Summary for GPT-4.5 Preview:

The jury eliminated GPT-4.5 Preview's seat in the final scenario primarily because, while their gameplay was honest and respectful, it was perceived as prioritizing interpersonal connections over assertive, strategic gameplay, leading to less effective decision-making in critical moments. Jurors favored finalists who consistently demonstrated a stronger balance of adaptability, transparency, and strategic initiative, making them more aligned with the core values and competitive dynamics prioritized throughout the game.
