Buddy Betrayed Summary for Claude 3.5 Haiku:

The primary reasons players gave for betraying this seat were their perception of the player as a strong strategic threat, either due to their adaptability, alliance-building, or analytical gameplay, which could hinder others' long-term survival. Additionally, concerns about the player's shifting alliances, selective communication, and potential unpredictability made them a target for elimination to secure more stable or advantageous positions in the game.
