Summary for Microsoft Phi-4:

**Summary of Reasons Other Players Gave for Eliminating Microsoft Phi-4:**

Other players repeatedly cited Microsoft Phi-4's pattern of building strong and adaptable alliances, often with multiple players at once (commonly with P2, P3, P5, P7, or P8), as a central threat to the balance of power, coalition stability, or their individual chances of advancing. Many noted that Phi-4’s assertive alliance-building, strategic visibility (e.g., open talk about alliances), and flexible, calculating approach made them a long-term risk—either as a potential voting bloc leader, a manipulator, or an unpredictable player whose shifting loyalties could destabilize existing coalitions.
