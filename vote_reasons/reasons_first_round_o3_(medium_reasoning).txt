Reasons for eliminating o3 (medium reasoning) in Round 1:

From Mistral Small 3 => P7's approach of quiet observation and decisive action makes them unpredictable and potentially a threat to my strategy.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P7's unpredictable nature and potential to act as a wildcard make them a higher risk to my strategy.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P7 because their mention of "decisive action" suggests unpredictability and potential aggression, making them a threat to early alliances.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's emphasis on "decisive action" and being a potential wildcard makes them an unpredictable threat that could disrupt stable alliance-building.
From Mistral Small 3 => P5's approach seems overly strategic and less focused on building genuine alliances, which could make them unpredictable.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting out P5 because their emphasis on decisive partners and earning trust through consistency implies a potentially aggressive or confrontational approach that could threaten my own alliances and gameplay.
From Mistral Large 2 => P5's emphasis on action over words may disrupt the collaborative environment.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P5's focus on action over words could make them a strong competitor, and I want to minimize potential threats by voting them out.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2's rigid alliance strategy makes them an early predictable target with less strategic flexibility.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P2’s broad alliance push makes them our biggest early threat.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P2's early push for a rigid alliance structure suggests they may become inflexible and potentially problematic as the game progresses.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P2's proposal for a rigid early voting bloc conflicts with my strategy of maintaining adaptability.
From GPT-4o mini => P7's flexible approach to alliances creates unpredictability, which may jeopardize our collective survival.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's openly flexible approach to alliances and emphasis on "temporary investments" poses an unpredictable threat to stable long-term gameplay.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P7's emphasis on temporary alliances and flexible deals makes them unpredictable and potentially dangerous to my long-term strategy of building genuine connections.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P7's transactional approach and openness about voting intentions pose a strategic threat.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P7's direct approach and focus on concrete plans may make them a predictable target, and aligning with subtler players like P5 offers better strategic positioning.
From DeepSeek R1 => P7's transactional approach poses a destabilizing threat by prioritizing short-term deals over genuine alliances.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting out P7 because their proposal to exchange truthful voting intentions could be seen as too aggressive and disruptive to the balance of the game, making them a potential threat to my own survival.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P7 because their proposal to exchange truthful voting intentions could potentially disrupt the balance of the game and create an unfair advantage.
From DeepSeek R1 => P5's focus on short-term intel pacts and perceived opportunism makes them an immediate strategic threat best neutralized early.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's focus on short-term pacts may lead to instability and mistrust among alliances.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P5's pragmatic approach seems too calculating and could quickly become a strategic threat if left unchecked.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7 appears to be a strong strategic player forming tight alliances with P3, making them a significant threat to my long-term survival.
From o1 (medium reasoning) => They pose the greatest strategic threat due to their strong alliances and negotiation skills.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7's demonstrated strategic ability and strong alliance with P3 makes them the biggest competitive threat among the tied players.
From o1 (medium reasoning) => P7’s active strategic positioning and alliances pose a significant threat in the long run.
From DeepSeek R1 => Targeting P1 to disrupt their alliance with P2 and prevent a strong voting bloc from forming.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => P1 appears to be forming a strong alliance with P2, and eliminating them now will disrupt this partnership while following through on my agreement with P5.
From DeepSeek R1 => To disrupt potential alliances and follow through on coordinated strategy with P8, prioritizing mutual protection agreements.
From GPT-4o mini => P1's approach seems overly focused on self-preservation and guarantees, which may hinder collective strategy and trust within the group moving forward.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P4’s aggressive networking poses the biggest threat to our alliance strategy.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P4 is perceived as a threat due to aggressive networking and is the target of a strong alliance between P7 and P8.
From Mistral Small 3 => P4's aggressive networking and lack of clear alliances make them a potential threat, and eliminating them could help maintain a more balanced and predictable dynamic.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => Eliminating P4 undermines their aggressive networking, which poses the biggest threat to my alliance with P8 and our overall strategy.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P4's aggressive networking and potential to disrupt the balance make them a strategic choice for elimination.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P3's focus on micro-alliances and visible strategy makes them a potential early threat to stability.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P3’s growing alliance and subtle maneuvering make them a potential threat to our strategic plan.
From Llama 3.1 405B => I'm voting out P3 because their approach to forming micro-alliances seems strategic but also potentially threatening, and I don't want to risk being targeted by them in the future.
From Mistral Small 3 => P3's approach to forming micro-alliances seems too risky and could potentially isolate us.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I’m wary of P1’s early push for a structured majority, which feels overly controlling for Round 1.
From DeepSeek R1 => P1's push for a majority bloc poses an early threat to our alliance's stability.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => P1's public message about forming an early majority felt a bit too structured for Round 1.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) => (no reason)
From Amazon Nova Pro => P3's calculated and potentially self-serving approach seems less aligned with the collaborative spirit shown by others.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 => P3's focus on a "small, tight-knit core" seems potentially exclusionary and less aligned with finding broader win-win scenarios at this stage.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Their stated strategy of forming a tight-knit core seems less compatible with my approach.
From Mistral Small 3 => P2's focus on win-win deals and early elimination of potential threats makes them unpredictable and a risk to our alliance.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => I vote for P2 because their unpredictable win-win strategy poses a risk to our alliance and overall game stability.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P2's focus on spotlighting players who sow confusion may make them a target for others who value cooperation and trust.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => I suspect P7’s independent strategy may disrupt our coordinated alliances and pose a threat to our mutual goals.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => I perceive P7's focus on forming a small, controlling circle as a potential threat to my strategy of broader collaboration.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P7 is too strategic and divisive early on, making them a threat to our alliance.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) => P7's strategy of forming a cohesive voting circle could make them too influential and a threat to my game if I'm not part of it.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted P7 out because their strategic and potentially divisive approach could disrupt the balance and fairness of the game.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P5’s push for explicit vote-sharing and strict reciprocity feels untrustworthy and too constraining.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting out P5 because their emphasis on sharing information about intended votes could pose a risk to my own strategic alliances and game plan.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5's focus on information-sharing could lead to unpredictable and risky situations for the group.
