From o3 (medium reasoning) => Reused script and low-responsiveness signals make P6 an unreliable partner going forward.
From GLM-4.5 => P8's alignment with P1 threatens my core alliance with P2, and eliminating P8 disrupts their potential to control the endgame.

From Qwen 3 30B A3B => Disrupt the strong, predictable alliance between P8 and P4 to weaken their combined influence.

From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P8 because their pragmatic and potentially opportunistic approach seems like a hidden threat to alliances and stability.
From Grok 4 => P8's aggressive push to dismantle alliances like P4-P7 introduces unnecessary instability, whereas preserving collaborative players aligns better with my strategy for mutual survival.

From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P3's pragmatic alliances and focus on concrete deals pose a strategic threat to my goals.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P3 because, despite their claim of being a stable partner, they have fewer cumulative votes and targeting them could strategically shift the balance of power in the next round.
From GLM-4.5 => Eliminating P3 aligns with our core alliance strategy to fracture potential opposition and consolidate vote control with P6 and P2.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => Eliminating P3 removes a pragmatic, alliance-prone player who could easily pivot and destabilize our trio's control over the vote.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P3's history of bloc-flipping and unverified claims of control over P1/P2/P7 make them the most volatile threat, while P4 and P6 offer stability through their proven alliance and lower cumulative votes.
