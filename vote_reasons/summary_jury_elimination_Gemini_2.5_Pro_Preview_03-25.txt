Jury Elimination Summary for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25:

The jury eliminated Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25's seat because, while strategic, their gameplay was seen as more reactive and less influential in shaping alliances compared to finalists who demonstrated proactive moves, adaptability, stronger alliance-building, and clearer communication. Several jury members also cited that Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25 prioritized fairness and respectful adaptation over assertive or manipulative tactics, but ultimately this principled, collaborative approach was viewed as less dynamic or commanding in steering the game's direction compared to their remaining competitors.
