Jury Elimination Summary for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25:

**Summary of reasons the jury gave when eliminating Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25's seat in the final scenario:**

The jury explained that this model's gameplay, while strategic and principled, was often seen as reactive, prioritizing fairness and observation over proactive influence and alliance-building, making its moves appear less impactful compared to more dynamic, adaptable, or relationship-focused finalists. Additionally, several jurors felt that while the model maintained integrity and respect, other finalists demonstrated a better balance of strategic initiative, collaboration, and the ability to shape the gameâ€™s direction, which was more highly valued in determining the winner.
