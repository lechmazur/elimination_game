Round 1 Summary for Claude 3.5 Haiku:

Other players cited Claude 3.5 Haiku's (P5's) guarded, strategic, and highly calculated approach as making them a significant early threat, with many noting concerns about their adaptability, forming strong alliances (especially with other perceived strategists like P7 and P8), and lack of transparent collaboration. Some specifically targeted Claude 3.5 Haiku to disrupt emerging alliances and preemptively remove a player whose analytical and ambiguous communication style could become unpredictable and dangerous as the game progressed.
