Buddy Betray reasons by o3 (medium reasoning):

From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 stands out as the loosest link in current alliances, so eliminating them reduces unpredictability and keeps larger targets available.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your self‑vote last round showed you’re an unreliable end‑game partner, so I’m keeping the numbers steady.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 keeps drawing the most heat, and cutting them now is the safest way to stay with the likely majority.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your shifting alliances create too much endgame volatility to keep you.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2’s repeated communication failures make coordination risky, and the group consensus is to remove that instability.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => You broke our core alliance in the tie and openly targeted me, so I’m honoring my day-one pact with P4.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Breaking the tie avoids a random tiebreaker and keeps trust with the other two, giving me room to maneuver at Final 3.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 is the only unaligned seat openly seeking to flip the majority against me, so removing them secures my position.
