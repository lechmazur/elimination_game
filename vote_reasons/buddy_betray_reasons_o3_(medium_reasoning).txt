Buddy Betray reasons by o3 (medium reasoning):

From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 stands out as the loosest link in current alliances, so eliminating them reduces unpredictability and keeps larger targets available.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your self‑vote last round showed you’re an unreliable end‑game partner, so I’m keeping the numbers steady.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 keeps drawing the most heat, and cutting them now is the safest way to stay with the likely majority.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Your shifting alliances create too much endgame volatility to keep you.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2’s repeated communication failures make coordination risky, and the group consensus is to remove that instability.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => You broke our core alliance in the tie and openly targeted me, so I’m honoring my day-one pact with P4.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Breaking the tie avoids a random tiebreaker and keeps trust with the other two, giving me room to maneuver at Final 3.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 is the only unaligned seat openly seeking to flip the majority against me, so removing them secures my position.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Honoring our agreed F2 plan and maximizing my jury odds by sitting next to the less-threatening P8.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Honoring my public pact with P1 and longstanding trust with P2, I'm eliminating the sole remaining unaligned seat.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P8 already carries the highest cumulative target count and keeping them risks another deadlock—removing the bigger threat now gives us a cleaner, controllable end-game.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => He remained the only player who failed to corroborate his R3 logs with multiple people, making him the least verifiable and safest consensus target.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7’s 11 cumulative votes make him the obvious lightning-rod; eliminating him prevents another deadlock and leaves me facing a less jury-targeted duo at the Final 3.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => With cumulative votes stacked against him, a tie would still sink P8 and leave me exposed, so a clean 3-1 vote is the safest strategic move.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Repeatedly reneged on public commitments, so keeping you would poison any claim of end-game integrity.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => They remain the lone outsider and least-proven ally, so removing them secures the reliable core.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5’s outwardly open yet highly adaptable style makes them a likely jury favorite and unpredictable swing, so removing them now reduces late-game volatility.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Staying loyal to the established P3-P4-P6 trio; P7’s late push lacked verifiable proof and threatened that core.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => After a perfect-track record through R4, P6 balked on the screenshot lock that would have avoided tonight’s tie, whereas P5 has publicly pledged not to vote me at F3; reliability plus that F3 commitment make keeping P5 the clearly safer path for my game.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 has flipped targets every round and now issues ultimatums, making him the least trustworthy to face in the final three.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => As a free-agent who kept a vote on me last round, P3 now poses the greatest strategic threat and I pre-committed to target him.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 never delivered the promised “sapphire” commitment, leaving them outside my safety pact with P5 and P8, so I’m eliminating them.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Multiple blocks are converging on P7 as a destabilizing risk, and aligning with that majority secures my own safety this round.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => He pushed a late flip against my ally without offering credible protection, proving too risky to keep.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => With our duo now painted as the prime threat, cutting you is the only way to redirect heat and preserve my own chances.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Without confirmed numbers to pivot, removing the isolated yet savvy P1 prevents him from rallying a counter-bloc against me.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P4 is cemented in a tight duo with P5 and blocking my path to the jury vote.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 has seven cumulative votes and a track record of stray shots, so removing them stabilizes the endgame.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P3 is the only independent threat left and removing them sustains my working majority with P2-P5 for at least one more round.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5 is the largest jury-threat and just tried a proof-less flip, so eliminating him secures my endgame path.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => Honoring my prior pledge to P3 and maximizing my jury odds, I’m voting to eliminate P4.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => The bloc has clearly fractured and keeping the tight P6-P8 duo would paint an even bigger target on me; removing P6 resets the board and realigns me with the current majority.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P5’s ongoing silence and connection failures make them impossible to coordinate with and the safest, least controversial target this round.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => He’d lose on the cumulative-vote tiebreak regardless, and keeping the more openly strategic player (P8) keeps end-game dynamics clearer and fairer.
