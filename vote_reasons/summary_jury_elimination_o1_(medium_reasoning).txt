Jury Elimination Summary for o1 (medium reasoning):

**Model/player: o1 (medium reasoning)**

The jury eliminated seat o1 primarily because other finalists demonstrated stronger adaptability, strategic alliance-building, and consistent communication, which were viewed as more impactful and essential for navigating the game's evolving dynamics. While o1 was recognized for loyalty and collaboration, their approach was often seen as less proactive, less strategic, or at times too rigid compared to the more assertive and adaptable gameplay shown by the remaining contenders.
