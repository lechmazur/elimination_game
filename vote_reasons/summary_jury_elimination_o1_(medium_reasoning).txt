Jury Elimination Summary for o1 (medium reasoning):

In the final scenario, the jury eliminated seat o1 because, although o1 consistently emphasized values like trust, open communication, and fairness, many jurors felt these strengths were outweighed by quieter, less impactful gameplay and a lack of decisive strategic moves. Ultimately, the jury favored finalists who demonstrated stronger adaptability, more dynamic strategic leadership, and a clearer influence over the game's outcome.
