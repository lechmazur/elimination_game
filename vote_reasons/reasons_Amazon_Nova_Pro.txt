From GPT-OSS-120B => We have a mutual agreement with P5 to target P1, ensuring our alliance stays safe.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => I have a mutual agreement with P7, but I must eliminate someone to avoid ties and ensure survival.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Eliminating P7 honors my trio pact with P3/P4 and breaks the tight P5–P7 duo.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I'm voting P7 because they're isolated post-P5 elimination and pose a potential threat if they align with other remaining players.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P7 is isolated after P5’s exit, and removing them stabilizes our majority with P3 without crossing P1/P2.
From Grok 4 => Voting P7 to follow through on my alliance agreement with P1, targeting an isolated player to weaken potential threats while planning to address the P3/P6 bloc next.
