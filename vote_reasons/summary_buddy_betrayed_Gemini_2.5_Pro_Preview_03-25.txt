Buddy Betrayed Summary for Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25:

Players often betray their seats due to perceiving others as bigger strategic threats, either because of their adaptability, potential to disrupt existing alliances, or their ability to sway jury votes in the endgame; frequently, the urge to maintain alliance unity, eliminate unpredictable players, or break up powerful duos also drives these decisions.
