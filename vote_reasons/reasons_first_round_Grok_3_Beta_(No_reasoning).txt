Reasons for eliminating Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) in Round 1:

From o1 (medium reasoning) => They are building alliances that could undermine my position with P1 and P2.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P7's eagerness and potential overextension could make them a liability as the game progresses.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3 hasn't shown strong strategic engagement or alignment with my goals.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P3 is playing too visibly and assertively early on, which could make them a long-term threat.
From Grok 3 Mini Beta (High) => (no reason)
From DeepSeek R1 => Aligning with P5 to eliminate a visible player and solidify our strategic alliance.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4 seems less strategically distinctive and might be an easier early elimination compared to others.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted out P4 because they seemed less directly aligned with my preferred balanced and strategic approach compared to others.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P4's alliance with P8 seems less strategically dynamic compared to the more flexible approaches demonstrated by P5 and P2.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I am voting for P4 because they have a strong alliance with P8, and eliminating P4 could potentially disrupt P8's strategy, providing a strategic advantage.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P6 feels overly eager and possibly disingenuous, which makes me question their long-term trustworthiness.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P6's focus on forming alliances without a clear strategy for identifying potential threats could make them a liability in later stages.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's enthusiasm seems insincere and potentially manipulative.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P7 is emerging as the most visible power‑player and breaking up the P7‑P6 duo weakens an early bloc.
From o1 (medium reasoning) => They appear too charismatic and I suspect they may quickly form a power bloc that threatens my position.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P7 seems to be forming a strong duo with P6 and their initial message was quite forward about building alliances, making them a strategic threat to neutralize early.

From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3 appears well-connected and strategic, making them a strong early competitor.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P3's alliances, while strong, seem less strategically advantageous compared to the collaborative potential of P8 with P6 and P4.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P2's approach seems too focused on building trust and alliances without a clear strategic edge, making them a less threatening competitor early on.
From Mistral Large 2 => P2's overly open approach might lead to unpredictable alliances and potential missteps.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P2's excessive openness and eagerness to connect may lead to strategic missteps, making them a safer elimination choice without uniting others against us.

From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P7’s loyalty is unproven and they pose a risk to our alliance.
From GPT-4o mini => P7's focus on building connections may lead to forming strong alliances that could threaten my position in the game.

From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P6 appears to be forming a strong early alliance with P4, which could become a threat if left unchecked.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P6's alliance with P4 appears strong, making them a potential threat if left unchecked.

From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P6's alliance-building could threaten our strategic partnership.
