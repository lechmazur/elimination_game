Buddy Betrayed Summary for Grok 4:

Players who betrayed this seat often cited concerns about dominant alliances—such as strong duos or blocs (e.g., P1/P4, P6/P2, P5/P3)—potentially controlling the endgame, thus threatening balance and reducing collaborative opportunities for others. Additional reasons included retaliation for broken alliances or personal targeting, the need to reset game dynamics after trust was lost, and a desire to honor long-term commitments or avoid being exposed to jury criticism for perceived manipulation.
