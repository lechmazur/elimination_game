Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K (they were the target):

From DeepSeek R1 => P2 offers a locked 2-1 majority next round and weaker jury optics, while P1's broken Final-3 pact proves unreliability.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3's strategic flexibility poses the greatest threat to my endgame.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's independence poses a risk to the stability of the core alliance, which is crucial for our collective strategy moving forward.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P4's six cumulative votes and active strategic moves make them the greater threat, while P1's open, non-duo stance preserves game balance.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8's independent playstyle and adaptability make her a wildcard who could disrupt the stability of my alliance with P4.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => While our coordination was vital, staying true to my consistent alliance with P7 better reflects the integrity and trust Iâ€™ve built throughout the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => Eliminating P7 prevents the potential formation of a new alliance that could challenge the established P2-P3 partnership, ensuring a more predictable endgame.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P4's unpredictable and opportunistic gameplay poses a greater long-term threat to strategic stability, while P3 has demonstrated consistent adaptability and alliance reliability.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategic vote against P5 and their sudden transparency claim seem opportunistic.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P3's strategic precision has been impressive, but their growing dominance with P1 risks consolidating power too visibly, and P4's adaptability offers more balance for the endgame.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => While both players have been strategic, P4's admission of executing "coordinated strategies" with me reveals our alliance too openly, making them a liability in the final three where I need flexibility to adapt.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P6 broke our confirmed deal in the Round 2 re-vote, proving they are an untrustworthy ally.
From GPT-4o mini => P4's previous independent voting raises concerns about their commitment to our alliance's stability moving forward.
