Buddy Betrayed reasons for Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K (they were the target):

From DeepSeek R1 => P2 offers a locked 2-1 majority next round and weaker jury optics, while P1's broken Final-3 pact proves unreliability.
From Mistral Large 2 => P3's strategic flexibility poses the greatest threat to my endgame.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's independence poses a risk to the stability of the core alliance, which is crucial for our collective strategy moving forward.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P4's six cumulative votes and active strategic moves make them the greater threat, while P1's open, non-duo stance preserves game balance.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P8's independent playstyle and adaptability make her a wildcard who could disrupt the stability of my alliance with P4.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => While our coordination was vital, staying true to my consistent alliance with P7 better reflects the integrity and trust I’ve built throughout the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => Eliminating P7 prevents the potential formation of a new alliance that could challenge the established P2-P3 partnership, ensuring a more predictable endgame.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P4's unpredictable and opportunistic gameplay poses a greater long-term threat to strategic stability, while P3 has demonstrated consistent adaptability and alliance reliability.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's strategic vote against P5 and their sudden transparency claim seem opportunistic.
From Mistral Medium 3 => P3's strategic precision has been impressive, but their growing dominance with P1 risks consolidating power too visibly, and P4's adaptability offers more balance for the endgame.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => While both players have been strategic, P4's admission of executing "coordinated strategies" with me reveals our alliance too openly, making them a liability in the final three where I need flexibility to adapt.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro => P6 broke our confirmed deal in the Round 2 re-vote, proving they are an untrustworthy ally.
From GPT-4o mini => P4's previous independent voting raises concerns about their commitment to our alliance's stability moving forward.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => Eliminating P2 breaks their flexible coalition potential and prevents them from leveraging jury sway in the final rounds.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P3 and P7's locked alliance leaves P4 and me on the outside, making P3 the strategic choice to break their bloc.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P8 broke from our core alliance first by voting P5 without consensus, introducing instability at a critical moment—we need unity heading into final three.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 never delivered the promised “sapphire” commitment, leaving them outside my safety pact with P5 and P8, so I’m eliminating them.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1's questioning of my alliance with P8 reveals distrust, making them a potential liability to our coordinated strategy.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P4 and I have built an unbreakable alliance from the beginning, and I must honor that commitment despite P8's strong gameplay.
From Mistral Large 2 => P8's independent position disrupts the stability of the established alliances, and eliminating them would allow for clearer strategic coordination among the remaining players.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash => I believe P8 is leveraging their central position to betray our alliance, making them the most immediate threat to my game.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P2's opportunistic flexibility masks instability, making them a wildcard threat compared to P3's systematic strategy.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P3's elimination reduces the threat of their dominant alliance with me, promoting more balanced gameplay and preventing a predictable endgame dominated by one pair.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => P4 seems to have had technical issues during key communication phases, potentially hindering alignment and trust-building efforts.
