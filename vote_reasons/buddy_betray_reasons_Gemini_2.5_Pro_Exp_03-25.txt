Buddy Betray reasons by Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25:

From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P5 betrayed their long-term partner last round and likely made a deal with P1/P4 to eliminate me this round, making them the most immediate and untrustworthy threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P7 betrayed our agreed voting plan in two consecutive tie-breaks, proving completely untrustworthy.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P3 voted against my closest ally last round, demonstrating untrustworthiness and alignment with the opposing bloc.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P1 has accumulated significantly more votes against them throughout the game compared to P2, indicating they are perceived as a larger threat by the group.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P6 betrayed our agreed plan last round, proving unreliable, and their proposal this round feels like a setup.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P4 betrayed our long-standing alliance in Round 4 and cannot be trusted to stick to our agreement this round, making them the primary threat.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P1 broke our agreed vote last round, targeted my ally P3, and has been evasive about rebuilding trust.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P8 is the only player remaining outside the established P1-P2-P6 alliance, and eliminating them secures the final three for our core group.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P6 proposed a suspicious plan to vote P8 immediately after P8 saved P6, likely attempting to manipulate my vote while the P3/P6/P8 bloc targets me.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P4 seems to be the core strategist of the opposing alliance and consistently rejected any negotiation, making them the primary obstacle.
From Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 => P5's recent private messages have been confused and unreliable, making them too unpredictable to trust in this final elimination before the finale.
