Buddy Betrayed reasons for Mistral Medium 3 (they were the target):

From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P8 has been my consistent target since Round 1 due to their unpredictable "bold moves" approach and the fact they keep receiving votes shows others share my concerns about their threat level.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P4 publicly undermined our alliance after privately coordinating votes, proving untrustworthy and strategically volatile.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P4 disrupts their strong alliance with P8 and removes a central strategic player, enhancing my chances in the final round.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P8 seems too strategically calculated and might pose a long-term threat to my game positioning.
From DeepSeek R1 => P1's strategic leadership and influence make them the bigger jury threat compared to P8.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P1 makes a compelling case: eliminating P6 breaks a locked trio and ensures a balanced Final 3 where no one has runaway control.
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => Eliminating P4 breaks up the strongest remaining duo, restoring balance and increasing my flexibility heading into the final rounds.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 is the most skilled individual player and biggest threat to win if they reach the final rounds.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P2 breaks the strong P2-P8 alliance, allowing P3 to form a new majority with P1 and P4 for better strategic positioning.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P2's rigidity makes them a predictable and vulnerable target, posing a threat to our alliance's adaptability.
From o4-mini (high reasoning) => P1’s inconsistent messaging and broad alliances make them a strategic threat to our core alliance.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P5's proactive alliance with P6 and strategic coordination to target others early poses a greater long-term threat compared to P1's more collaborative, less overtly aggressive approach.
From Mistral Large 2 => P8's open targeting of P7 and strong alliance with P6 makes them a central figure in current instability.
From Qwen 2.5 Max => P3 is part of a strong duo with me, but eliminating them now weakens our ability to dominate later.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I choose to eliminate P7 because, despite their strong strategic awareness and collaborative approach, their alliance with P2 seemed more opportunistic and less genuine compared to P1's consistent and authentic relationship-building efforts throughout the game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P1 is trying to manipulate me into breaking my established alliance with P7 while offering no real proof of their claimed "core alliance."
From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => Breaking up the strongest duo gives me more flexibility and control in the Final 3, while P3 offers loyalty and a clear deal moving forward.
From Microsoft Phi-4 => Disrupts the strong P8-P7 alliance, potentially isolating P7.
From Claude Opus 4 (no reasoning) => P1's consistent survival through every round combined with their subtle coordinated messaging patterns suggests they've been operating with hidden alliances while positioning themselves as adaptable, making them the greater strategic threat in the endgame.
From DeepSeek R1 => Eliminating P6 restores the trio's majority and prevents exposing P3 to vengeful retaliation from P1 in the next round.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P6's consistent duo play and alliance-hopping throughout the game makes them a stronger strategic threat than P2's passive but honest approach.
From GPT-4o mini => P6's controlling style and reliance on a rigid alliance structure could hinder adaptability and flexibility, which are crucial in the endgame.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P7's adaptability and silent alliance with P5 pose a greater strategic threat, as they thrive in complexity and have demonstrated precise, coordinated moves to outlast others.
From Qwen 3 235B A22B => P2's history of decisive alliances and strategic coordination poses a consistent threat to control the game's direction, making their removal critical to balancing power dynamics.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P6’s consistent strategy and established alliances offer greater stability and long-term viability in this unpredictable game.
From Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview (24k) => Prioritizing the established, reliable alliance with P7 over a new agreement.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6's focus on adaptability and clear communication makes them a strong player, and I see them as a potential threat in the long run.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 has been too strategically coordinated and is the most significant threat to my path to the final two.
From Llama 4 Maverick => I voted for P4 because they were unnecessarily harsh and dismissive in our private conversation, and their alliance with P3 and P6 seems too strong to challenge directly.
