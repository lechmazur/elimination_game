Reasons for eliminating Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp 03-25 in Round 1:

From Qwen QwQ-32B 16K => P6's generic strategy indicates lower threat potential.
From Mistral Small 3 => P6's straightforward approach seems too predictable and may not adapt well to the evolving dynamics of the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P6 hasn't shown strong strategic initiative or alliances, making them less valuable in the long run.
From GPT-4.5 Preview => P8 seems overly cautious and may hesitate to make decisive moves later on.
From Mistral Large 2 => P8 and P7's focus on open communication might hinder their ability to make strategic eliminations later.
From GPT-4.5 Preview => I see stronger potential for strategic collaboration with P1 and P6 based on initial interactions and conversations.
From Mistral Small 3 => P8's approach seems more polished and calculated, which might be risky in the early stages of the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P8's approach seems less aligned with forming strong alliances compared to P1 and P6, who have demonstrated strategic depth and connection-building.
From Mistral Large 2 => P8's approach, while transparent, may lack the strategic depth needed for later rounds.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P7's strategy seemed less defined compared to others, making them a safer initial elimination.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7's strategy seems less defined compared to others, making them a potential liability in forming strong alliances.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P7's emphasis on building genuine connections and open communication aligns well with the group's values, but P5, P2, and P8 have stronger existing alliances and strategic partnerships that may offer more immediate benefits for navigating the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P7's strategy seems less defined compared to the others, who have emphasized clear communication and strategic alliances more explicitly.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P6's emphasis on actions over words suggests potential unpredictability and a higher risk of betrayal.
From Claude 3.5 Sonnet 2024-10-22 => P6's emphasis on "actions over words" and dismissive tone toward opening statements suggests they might be setting up justification for future betrayals, making them an unpredictable and potentially dangerous player.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P6's emphasis on actions over words makes them a wildcard, hard to predict and potentially disruptive.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting out P6 because their public statement came across as somewhat dismissive and uncooperative, suggesting they might be difficult to form a reliable alliance with.
From Llama 3.3 70B => I'm voting out P2 because their public message seemed overly strategic and open, potentially attracting too much early attention and alliances, making them a stronger competitor to eliminate sooner rather than later.
From o1 (medium reasoning) => They appear poised to gain strong influence that could threaten my position.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P2 seems strategically sharp and could become a strong threat if allowed to build more connections.
From o3-mini (medium reasoning) => P2’s overly calculating approach suggests he might later exploit alliances to disrupt balanced strategies.
From Grok 2 12-12 => P2's emphasis on watching actions over engaging in dialogue suggests a less collaborative approach, which may hinder forming the alliances I value.
From DeepSeek-V3 => P2’s focus on actions over words makes them a potential wildcard, and eliminating them early reduces unpredictability.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P2's skeptical and action-oriented approach could disrupt early alliance-building.
From Claude 3.7 Sonnet => As discussed with P1, P2's skeptical approach could disrupt alliance-building, making them a strategic first target to eliminate.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P6 seemed the least engaged in forming early alliances and was more observational.
From Claude 3.5 Haiku => P6 seems the least engaged and most passive, making them a strategic first elimination target.
From Mistral Large 2 => P6's cautious and observant approach might hinder early alliance building.
