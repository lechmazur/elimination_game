From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P3's general emphasis on trust and collaboration lacks specific evidence of strategic execution, whereas P5 and P1 have demonstrated actionable alliances (e.g., P5 with P2, P1 with P7). P5 directly highlights P3's "flexibility" as a weakness, suggesting unpredictability in their approach.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P3 has shown the least strategic commitment and concrete partnerships, making vague appeals to collaboration without demonstrating the reliable alliance-building that P5 has proven with me or the consistent follow-through that P1 has displayed.
From DeepSeek R1 05/28 => P3 lacks demonstrated alliance strength and presents the lowest strategic risk to my core partnership with P6.

From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2’s off-bloc vote last round signals unpredictability, so removing them stabilizes alliances and reduces future risk.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2 has shown the least reliability (off-bloc vote last round); removing that volatility keeps both alliance paths open and stabilises the board.
From Grok 4 => P2's past betrayal in the R2 tie-break against P3 proves their unreliability, and eliminating them fractures the P1-P2 duo to strengthen our core trio's stability.
From GLM-4.5 => P2's betrayal in Round 2 and ongoing alliance with P1 make them a strategic threat to fracture.
From o3 (medium reasoning) => P2’s erratic past votes and unwavering duo with P1 threaten coalition stability going forward.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => P6 gave the weakest reciprocity/consistency signal (no “steady” keyword and a generic intro), making them least aligned with my strategy.
From GPT-OSS-120B => P6 appears aggressive toward P4 and poses a threat to our alliance.

From GPT-4o Mar 2025 => P5 continues to offer vague alliance talk without concrete signals, making them difficult to trust strategically.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P5 appears to be forming a dangerous alliance with P3, and eliminating the weaker partner first will isolate P3 for future rounds.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P5's overly generic collaborative approach lacks the strategic specificity and tactical awareness that P3 has demonstrated throughout the game.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P5's collaborative approach, while strategic, may not be as decisive as P3's in disrupting potential alliances, making P5 a more suitable candidate for elimination in this tie.

From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P1 appears isolated after receiving votes in R1 and lacks strong alliances, making them the safest consensus target to eliminate.
From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => Outside my trusted alliance (P2/P3/P4), so eliminating P7 preserves our commitments and cleanly advances us toward F3.
From Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) => P7 is isolated outside our core alliance and needs to be eliminated before we address internal dynamics at final four.
