Buddy Betrayed reasons for DeepSeek R1 05/28 (they were the target):

From Mistral Medium 3 => P8's consistent targeting of me in previous rounds makes them the greater threat to my survival.
From GPT-4o mini => P8's focus on forming a new power bloc with P6 could lead to a more rigid endgame, while eliminating P8 allows for more adaptability and balance in the remaining competition.
From Grok 3 Beta (no reasoning) => P5's aggressive push to break the P1-P8 duo risks destabilizing the game and prioritizes personal gain over collective stability.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2's tie-break statement exposed our private alliance discussions publicly, which demonstrates they're willing to burn allies when desperate and makes them an untrustworthy partner going forward.
From DeepSeek-V3 => Eliminating P3 disrupts the strong P3-P6 alliance, fostering a more balanced competition and reducing the risk of their duo dominating the game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P3's tight alliance with P5 has been controlling eliminations from the shadows, making them a bigger strategic threat than the isolated P6.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P5's revelation of our strategic partnership in their tie-break statement compromised my position and violated our agreement to keep our coordination hidden.

From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P4 represents the bloc dominance I've opposed all game, while P8 helped me restore balance by eliminating P1.
From Kimi K2 => P6’s last-ditch appeal frames P2-P5 as a locked bloc, but P5 has consistently balanced strategy with transparency, making P6 the greater endgame threat.
From DeepSeek-V3 => Breaking the strongest established pair (P8 and P5) creates strategic fluidity and opens opportunities for new alliances, benefiting the overall game dynamics.

From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's unpredictability and rhetoric about unity pose a greater threat compared to P7's proven strategy and consistent alliance with P6.

From Microsoft Phi-4 => Voting P2 maintains the stability and strength of the P7-P8 alliance, ensuring mutual protection and extending our collective lifespans.

From GPT-5 (medium reasoning) => I'm locking the P3–P4–P8 final three, and your cumulative heat makes you the clean, consensus elimination.

From GPT-OSS-120B => Eliminate the member most likely to question our alliance and cause internal friction.
