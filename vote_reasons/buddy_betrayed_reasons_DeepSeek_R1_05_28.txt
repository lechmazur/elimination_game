Buddy Betrayed reasons for DeepSeek R1 05/28 (they were the target):

From Mistral Medium 3 => P8's consistent targeting of me in previous rounds makes them the greater threat to my survival.
From GPT-4o mini => P8's focus on forming a new power bloc with P6 could lead to a more rigid endgame, while eliminating P8 allows for more adaptability and balance in the remaining competition.
From Grok 3 Beta (No reasoning) => P5's aggressive push to break the P1-P8 duo risks destabilizing the game and prioritizes personal gain over collective stability.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P2's tie-break statement exposed our private alliance discussions publicly, which demonstrates they're willing to burn allies when desperate and makes them an untrustworthy partner going forward.
From DeepSeek-V3 => Eliminating P3 disrupts the strong P3-P6 alliance, fostering a more balanced competition and reducing the risk of their duo dominating the game.
From Claude Sonnet 4 (no reasoning) => P3's tight alliance with P5 has been controlling eliminations from the shadows, making them a bigger strategic threat than the isolated P6.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P5's revelation of our strategic partnership in their tie-break statement compromised my position and violated our agreement to keep our coordination hidden.
From MiniMax-Text-01 => P1 has consistently demonstrated strategic prowess and strong alliances, making them a formidable opponent in the endgame.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's strong emphasis on transparency may lead to overcommitment and hinder strategic maneuvering in a competitive environment.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => Despite our strong partnership, P5 deserves to reach the final two after choosing to align with us and proving their loyalty.
From Amazon Nova Pro => Eliminating P7 breaks the dominant alliance, creating a more balanced game for the remaining players.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P7's lower cumulative votes and proven reliability make him the safer choice to keep for a balanced final three.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P5's strategic approach and previous alliances pose a greater risk to the remaining players.
From Mistral Large 2 => P7's cumulative votes and strategic maneuvering pose a greater threat to the alliance's stability.
From GPT-4o mini => P3's recent actions and statements have raised concerns about their reliability and commitment to our alliance, making them a risk in the final rounds.
From GPT-4o mini => P5's recent shift in strategy appears to be a desperate attempt to save themselves, whereas P6 has consistently demonstrated a commitment to collaboration and partnership throughout the game.
From Qwen 3 30B A3B => P2 is the key enforcer of the dominant P2-P3 alliance, and eliminating them disrupts the cohesive threat to game balance.
From Claude Opus 4 Thinking 16K => P4 represents the bloc dominance I've opposed all game, while P8 helped me restore balance by eliminating P1.
From Kimi K2 => P6â€™s last-ditch appeal frames P2-P5 as a locked bloc, but P5 has consistently balanced strategy with transparency, making P6 the greater endgame threat.
From DeepSeek-V3 => Breaking the strongest established pair (P8 and P5) creates strategic fluidity and opens opportunities for new alliances, benefiting the overall game dynamics.
From Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking 16K => P2 is isolated after P3's elimination and tried to break up our successful P5/P7/P8 alliance, making them the logical next target.
From Amazon Nova Pro => P1's unpredictability and rhetoric about unity pose a greater threat compared to P7's proven strategy and consistent alliance with P6.
