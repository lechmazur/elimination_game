Buddy Betray reasons by Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21:

From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P8 is the most vulnerable player and eliminating them strengthens my position with P6.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P8 seemed slightly less strategically focused in our recent private chats.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P8 has formed a visible alliance with P2, making them a more defined strategic player to target at this stage.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P7 is the least integrated into the apparent core alliance and seems to be observing from the periphery, making them a strategic vote to consolidate power.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P6 is the most vulnerable player after P4's elimination and eliminating them is a strategic move to reduce immediate threat.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P2's tie-break statement is more general and less convincing compared to P4's direct approach and clear alliance, making P2 a slightly less predictable player to keep in the game.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P5 was previously voted for by me in the tie-break, and eliminating P5 seems like a consistent strategic move.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P3 is being vague and untrustworthy in private chats, making them a less reliable partner than P5.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => To break the tie and ensure the survival of P5, my long-term ally.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => To prevent the P7/P8 alliance from becoming too dominant, and to promote a more balanced endgame.
From Gemini 2.0 Flash Think Exp 01-21 => P7 was a bit too eager to form an alliance early on, which made me slightly suspicious of their long-term strategy.
